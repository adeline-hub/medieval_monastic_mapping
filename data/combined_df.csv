It is located on the right bank of the Chepelare River, 189 km from Sofia and 10 km south of Asenovgrad, and is directly subordinate to the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The monastery is known and appreciated for the unique combination of Byzantine, Georgian and Bulgarian culture, united by the common faith.

History
The monastery was founded in 1083 by Prince Gregory Pakourianos, a prominent statesman and military commander in the Byzantine service, as a Georgian-dominated Orthodox monastery.[1] He set up a seminary(school) for the youth at the monastery. The curriculum included religion, as well as mathematics, history and music. In the 13th century, the Georgian and Chalcedonic Armenian monks[2] of the Petritsioni (Bachkovo) Monastery lost their domination over the monastery, but their traditions were preserved until the beginning of 14th century and an Armenian Gospel from the 10th century that came from this monastery still exists today.[3] During the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Bachkovo Monastery was patronized by Tsar Ivan Alexander, which is evidenced by an image of him on the arches of the ossuary's narthex. It is believed that the founder of Tarnovo Literary School and last patriarch of the mediaeval Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Euthymius, was exiled by the Turks and worked in the school of the monastery in the early 15th century.

Although the monastery survived the first waves of Turkish invasion in Bulgarian lands, it was then looted and destroyed, but restored near the end of the 15th century. The refectory, whose mural paintings by an anonymous painter bear a significant artistic value, was reconstructed in 1601 and the Church of Mary, still preserved today, was finished in 1604.

Bachkovo Monastery is the final resting place of both Patriarch Euthymius (1330–1404) and Patriarch Cyril (1953–1971).";

The monastery was founded in the 12th or 13th century, its heyday being from the 16th to the 18th century when, thanks to its prolific scriptoria, it was the dominant literary centre of Ottoman-ruled northern Bulgaria. In its present form, the monastery includes a large mid-19th-century church and two chapels.

History
The Etropole Monastery is located 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) from the eponymous town, which lies to the north-east of the Bulgarian capital Sofia.[1] The closest inhabited place is the village of Ribaritsa, which is 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) west of the monastery.[2] The monastery lies among maple woodlands at the foot of the Balkan Mountains.[3][4] The Etropole Monastery of the Holy Trinity (Bulgarian: Етрополски манастир „Света Троица”, Etropolski manastir „Sveta Troitsa”), also known as Varovitets (Варовитец), is a Bulgarian Orthodox monastery near the town of Etropole in west-central Bulgaria.

The monastery was founded during the Second Bulgarian Empire, either in the 12th[5] or 13th century.[1] According to a stone inscription reportedly placed into the foundations of the church, the exact year of its foundation is 1158, during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria.[2][3] The medieval part of the monastery's history is documented in its commemoration codex (pomenik), which also includes lists of medieval Bulgarian and Serbian monarchs.[5]

The Etropole Monastery reached its apogee between the 16th and 18th centuries, when it emerged as the most important literary and cultural centre of the northern Bulgarian lands[1][6] under Ottoman rule, with its own scriptoria and a calligraphic school with a characteristic style. Under abbots Anthony, Zachary and Raphael, who were in charge of the monastery from the 1620s to the 1640s, the Etropole Literary School was a major centre of production for chiefly religious manuscripts. Its influence spread throughout the Balkans to other schools of the time. Particularly active scribes of this period were the priest Valcho, hieromonk Daniel, John the Grammarian[5] and Basil of Sofia.[7] Thanks to the successful literary efforts of its community, the monastery was able to sustain itself through the sale of manuscripts,[8] in addition to donations from wealthy locals.[5] 76 works of the Etropole Literary School are housed by the National Library of Bulgaria and the Museum of Church History.[4]

In the late 19th century, during the last decades of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the time of Bulgaria's struggle for independence, the monastery provided shelter to national hero Vasil Levski and other anti-Ottoman revolutionaries.[9] Levski even had a hiding place specially built for himself at the monastery.[10] At present the monastery is inhabited by a small number of nuns.[2]

Architecture and culture
The monastery's present main church (katholikon) is a large cruciform three-naved church that features five hexagon-shaped turret domes.[1][2] The church was constructed in 1858 or 1859, though its exterior decoration was not finished until 1860 and its current set of interior frescoes were only painted from 1896 to 1907.[3][6] The main material in the church's construction, limestone, may be the origin of the monastery's alternative name, Varovitets (from Bulgarian варовит varovit, ""limy"").[11] The church was designed by the architect Ivan Boyanov (Boyanin) from Bratsigovo and built to replace the old monastery church, which was destroyed because of its deteriorating condition.[3] The same architect also designed a previous incarnation of the Saint Nedelya Church in Sofia.[4]

In addition to the main church, the Etropole Monastery also includes two smaller chapels and various residential buildings in the Bulgarian National Revival style, which are situated in a grass-covered yard.[1][2][11] The chapels are each dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saints Cosmas and Damian.[12] One of the rooms in the residential quarters functions as a small museum to Vasil Levski, focusing on his time hiding at the monastery.[11]

Among the valuable items in possession of the monastery are two 15th-century[4] crosses with rich silver decoration and a gold-plated ossuary.[1] The oldest icon from the Etropole Monastery is a rendition of the Holy Trinity of the Old Testament from 1598 painted by the teacher Nedyalko from Lovech; several 17th- and 18th-century icons previously in use at the monastery are now part of the National Art Gallery's collection.[3]

The monastery celebrates its holiday on Pentecost, the feast of the Holy Trinity. In the woods in the vicinity of the monastery are the Varovitets Waterfall, 15 metres (49 feet) high,[4] and its source, an eponymously named karst spring.[11][12]

There are also another three cottages and a caravan for visitors as well as a slightly smaller chapel of St Anthony. With 23 acres of land surrounding the monastery, the monks are able to be self sufficient as they grow their own vegetation and keep a range of animals, they also produce fresh cheese and honey.

The monastery is based in a tranquil rural environment, suitable for monks who wish to lead lives of celibacy, contemplation and prayer.

The monks lead a strict life of fasting and prayer. They follow a daily routine consisting of morning praises which begin at 5am, followed by a Holy Mass and Vespers in the evening. The monks also prepare their own Holy bread for the daily Eucharist.

Their menu consisted of meat (pork, mutton, goat, antelope, etc.), sorghum (in particular sorghum bread: kisra eaten from Meroitic times to the present day) and purslane. They practiced weaving, leather work and wrote documents[3]. They had two iron-casting workshops (furnaces have been found on site).[4][3] They possessed knowledge of medicine as evidenced by the remains of medicinal plants found at the site (Portulaca oleracea, Euphorbia aegyptiaca and Cleome gynandra). Three languages were spoken within the monastery: Coptic for the liturgy, ancient Nubian for everyday language, and Greek, many epigraphic inscriptions or on artifacts testify to this diversity. The average age of death was between 35 and 50 years old, the monks were buried nearby. A cemetery with 800 graves has been excavated to the south of the monastery.;"Qasr al Wizz (sometimes spelled Kasr el Wizz) is a Nubian monastery located on a rocky promontory, three kilometers north of Faras, in southern Egypt. Its name means ""Goose Palace"" in Arabic. It was dedicated to Apa Dioscorus (Dioscorus I of Alexandria) according to Artur Obluski[2] (based on inscriptions and manuscripts discovered at the site[3]). This site, consisting of a large church and the monastery itself, was occupied from the 6th to the 13th centuries, and was an important pilgrimage site. Submerged under Lake Nasser, it was excavated by archaeologist George T. Scanlon of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in 1965. Qasr el-Wizz (sometimes written Kasr el-Wizz, Qasr al-Wizz or simply “el-Wizz”) is a small, steep-sided mesa that once stood on the east bank of the Nile about 50 km south-west of Abu Simbel, in what is now the Egyptian sector of Lake Nasser.  
Although there are scattered Pharaonic sherds on the summit, almost everything still visible when the UNESCO Nubian Salvage Campaign began (1960s) belonged to two, clearly separated, medieval occupations:  

A. a fortified Christian monastery of the Kingdom of Nobadia (7th–12th c.) – the “qasr” ;  
B. a small Islamic tomb-shrine added after the Christian community had gone – the “mashhad”.

The site was completely excavated by the Oriental Institute Nubian Expedition (OINE, University of Chicago) in 1964-1965, then dismantled; its painted blocks and small finds are now in the Nubian Museum (Aswân), the Coptic Museum (Cairo) and the Sudan National Museum (Khartoum). Only the rock core remains under the water of Lake Nasser.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  The Christian phase: fortified monastery (“qasr”)
────────────────────────────────────────
Date & context  
• The enclosure, church and domestic ranges were built in one campaign c. AD 650-700, a generation after the conversion of Lower Nubia (c.540-580).  
• Ceramic sequences and 36 radiocarbon samples show continuous occupation until the later 12th c.; the latest datable dipinti fall around 1170-1180.

Plan in brief  
A square curtain wall (≈ 37 × 35 m; sandstone footings, mud-brick superstructure 4–4.5 m thick) surrounded:  
  – a three-aisled basilican church in the north-east corner (nave 13 × 8.8 m, eastern tri-apsidal arrangement);  
  – a refectory, kitchen/bakery with domed bread-ovens, wine-press and storerooms along the south curtain;  
  – two-storey ranges of monks’ cells on the west and north;  
  – a gate-tower with portcullis groove on the south wall.  

Murals & inscriptions  
• 143 registered painted scenes, roughly half in situ when found. Iconography matches the Faras school: Christ Pantokrator, Archangel Michael, St George, Nubian kings in liturgical dress, bishops in orans pose, and a rare series of Desert Fathers (Apollo, Pakhomios).  
• Texts in Greek, Coptic and Old Nubian: liturgical headings, donor dipinti, monks’ graffiti. A Coptic funerary stela names one “Stephanos hegoumenos of the monastery of St Mary at Wizz”, identifying the patron saint.  
• Palaeography and costume details bracket most of the wall-painting between the mid-8th and late-11th c.

Material life  
• Pottery: mainly “Early Nubian Christian Red Ware” (globular amphorae for wine and oil, funnel-necked bottles), later “Classic Nubian Painted Ware” with black-lined vegetal motifs.  
• 300+ woven-palm sandals, loom weights, spindle whorls, suggesting textile production for local exchange.  
• Agricultural installations on the narrow river flat below the rock – now submerged – included shadûf wells and windbreak walls; papyrus receipt slips mention wheat, barley, dates and goat cheese delivered “to the holy fortress (kastron) of Mary”.

Organisation & order  
No document names an order, but architectural parallels (Faras, Qaṣr Ibrim, Serra East) and the Coptic titulature “dayr” (monastery) imply a community of cenobitic monks under an abbot (ḥigoumenos), belonging to the Miaphysite (Coptic) Church of Nubia rather than to any outside rule such as Benedictine.  

End of the monastery  
Around the end of the 12th c. the compound was hastily cleaned out; floor levels above that point are sterile wind-blown sand.  No arrow-heads, burn layers or mass burials were found, so scholars think the garrison-monks withdrew peacefully in the face of the combined pressures that were crippling Christian Nubia (loss of long-distance trade, Blemmyan/Beja raids, and ultimately Ayyubid expansion).

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  The Islamic phase: the “mashhad”
────────────────────────────────────────
Construction  
• Probably early 15th c. on stratigraphic grounds; no radiocarbon sample is later than 1420 ± 50 AD.  
• A single-domed square mausoleum (5.6 × 5.8 m internal), rubble core with finely dressed sandstone corner-quoins robbed from the church. Qibla wall has a miḥrâb niche; the doorway faces west.  
• A low enclosure wall kept the older Christian ruins outside the ritual space.

Function & cult  
• Local oral tradition, collected in 1963 from Nubian boatmen, called the building “Abu l-Lizz” – “the Father (saint) of Plenty” – and women offered clay figurines for fertility.  
• No inscribed tombstone was found, but three simple shaft graves south of the mashhad contained male skeletons oriented toward Mecca.  

Relation to the older qasr  
All Islamic potsherds were confined to the area immediately around the shrine; the rest of the fortress remained a sand-filled ruin.  That, plus the careful segregation wall, suggests respect for – but not reoccupation of – the Christian remains.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Significance
────────────────────────────────────────
• Qasr el-Wizz is the best-preserved example of a Nubian fortified monastery and therefore a key comparative site for Faras, Qustul and Serra.  
• The ensemble shows, in microcosm, the succession so typical of the Middle Nile: Christian stronghold → abandonment → re-functionalisation as a Muslim saint’s tomb.  
• Because the buildings were buried by sand and never modernised, the excavators recovered an unparalleled corpus of daily-life objects (wooden spoons, leather buckets, writing tablets) normally lost in re-used monasteries.  
• The wall-paintings fill an important geographic gap between the great cathedral cycle at Faras and the fragments from Sai Island further south.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Where to see the material
────────────────────────────────────────
• Nubian Museum, Aswân – reconstructed south wall of the church with Archangel Michael; pottery and tools.  
• Coptic Museum, Cairo – five panels including the Nubian king and bishop in Eucharistic procession.  
• Sudan National Museum, Khartoum – two apostles panels and a set of dipinti on plaster flakes.  
• Oriental Institute, Chicago – excavation diaries, photographs and plan archives (online: OIMP volumes).

6.  One-minute summary
────────────────────────────────────────
Qasr el-Wizz began as a 7th-century Nubian Christian monastery dedicated to the Virgin, protected by thick fortress walls and decorated with vivid murals in the Faras style.  It flourished until about the 12th century, then fell silent.  Two centuries later a small domed Islamic shrine (mashhad) was built beside the deserted walls, turning the place into a local saint’s tomb while leaving the Christian remains largely intact.  Excavated during the 1960s UNESCO salvage campaign and now submerged under Lake Nasser, the site is remembered through hundreds of objects and paintings on display in Aswân, Cairo and Khartoum and through the meticulous records of the Oriental Institute.";

The term ""Tatev"" usually refers to the monastery. The monastic ensemble stands on the edge of a deep gorge of the Vorotan River. Tatev is known as the bishopric seat of Syunik and played a significant role in the history of the region as a center of economic, political, spiritual and cultural activity.

The Monastery of Tatev has been described as one of the two best-known monasteries in Armenia, along with Noravank in the province of Vayots Dzor.[1]

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the monastery hosted one of the most important Armenian medieval universities, the University of Tatev, which contributed to the advancement of science, religion and philosophy, reproduction of books and development of miniature painting. Scholars of the Tatev University contributed to the preservation of Armenian culture and creed during one of its most turbulent periods in its history. Monastic Feudalism

Boundary agreement between the villages Khut, Shinhar and Halizur (Halidzor) owned by the Tatev Monastery. Persian manuscript, dated 13 November 1400
Tatev Monastery was a feudal organization.[21] It became a prominent and influential monastic centre soon after its foundation, possessing expansive areas of land and a large number of villages. The earliest references to its foundation are described in Stepanos Orbelian's History of the Province of Syunik, where Orbelian describes the accord through which Prince Ashot, son of Prince Philipé of Syunik delineated its borders.[6]

Soon after the transfer of the lands, peasants of Tsouraberd (present day Svarants), Tamalek, Aveladasht and other villages, rejected the authority of the Monastery and began a prolonged struggle against it. Twice the protests transformed into open uprisings[21] and continued, with some interruptions, until 990 when King Vasak of Syunik razed Tsouraberd and dispersed its population . Historians link the uprisings to the Tondrakian Heresy, which appeared in Armenian history at roughly the same time as the peasant uprisings (9th–11th centuries) and which was also suppressed around the same time.[22]

The Tatev bishopric owned 47 villages and received tithes from 677 other villages.[23] It gained such economic power that in 940–950 Bishop Hakob attempted to secede from the Mother See of Etchmiadzin. His separatist dreams were dashed when Catholicos Anania Mokatsi anathematized him. Surrounding regions benefited from Tatev's weakened position, rejected its supremacy and established their own dioceses.[11] In 958, Bishop Vahan (later Catholicos Vahan Syunetsi) recovered some of the bishopric rights and properties.[9] In 1006, Bishop Hovhannes V succeeded in re-establishing the metropolitan privileges of the diocese.[10]

Tatev University
Tatev Monastery has played a notable role in the advancement of cultural life of Armenia. In his History of the Province of Syunik, Stepanos Orbelian describes how the monastery served as the repository for thousands of valuable manuscripts, monastic and official documents and contracts. The Monastery hosted a university that operated between 1390 and 1434, where instructors were educated and trained not only for the province of Syunik, but also for other regions of Armenia.

In the beginning of the 1340s, following the decline of the University of Gladzor, Hovhan Vorotnetsi departed from Vayots Dzor, and arriving in Dzghook, Vorotn, he obtained the blessing and patronage of the Orbelian princes to advance the educational system at Tatev. Vorotnetsi used his experience from Gladzor to revise the educational plan and to organize the admission and classification of students and instructors. This enabled Tatev to be transformed to a deserving university within a short period of time,[24] attracting students from various regions of Greater Armenia and Cilicia.[22]

Vorotnetsi organized the university into three departments – study of Armenian and foreign scriptures, the study of scriptural arts, and finally, the study of music. The first included the study of humanities and social sciences, philosophy, oration, grammar, literature and history. The second focused on calligraphy, artistic design of books and the painting of miniatures and murals. The third department included ancient music and musicology.[11]

Following the death of Vorotnetsi in 1388, Grigor Tatevatsi assumed the role of abbot. He succeeded in raising the standard of the University to unprecedented heights. During his tenure, Tatev experienced its most dynamic and creative period. Topics of instruction included Armenian literature, interpretation and analysis of the Old and New Testaments, works of the holy fathers, works of Plato, Aristotle, Philo of Alexandria and Porphyry, and their analysis.[24]

The University of Tatev became the leading scientific and cultural centre of the time. Its achievements appear even more significant when they are viewed in context with the turbulent political situation and endless devastations of the period, when the University was occasionally forced to migrate to avoid persecutions from invading forces.[25][26]

Tatev University led the effort to combat the influence of the Fratres Unitores in Armenia. The Unitores were an Armenian branch of the Dominican order and the result of an initiative taken by Pope John XXII to extend the influence of Holy See of Rome onto Asia and to Latinize Greater Armenia.[27] Scholars of Tatev University fought against the proselytizing of the Unitores and sought to diminish their influence on the Armenian Church and people.[25]

Following the collapse of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, scholars of Tatev, led by Grigor Tatevatsi and then his followers, especially Tovma Metsobetsi and Hovhannes Hermonetsi played an important role in convincing the authorities to repatriate of the supreme patriarchal throne of the Armenian Church from Sis to Etchmiadzin, the original See of Saint Gregory the Illuminator.[26] The effort succeeded in 1441 following the decisions of the National Congress of Etchmiadzin, proving to be one of the most significant events in Armenian history of that century.[24][25]

The prominence of the University began to wane following the death of Grigor Tatevatsi. In spite of the dauntless efforts of its new leaders, the political and economic conditions, compounded with the security complications of the period led Tatev to lose its luster and finally ceased to function following the invasions of Shah Rukh in 1434.[11][24]

The restoration of the monastery, re-establishing its educational legacy and reviving monastic life at Tatev is one of the main goals of Tatev Revival Program, a part of which is the Wings of Tatev aerial tramway,[2] a cableway from Tatev to the village of Halidzor, which was opened in October 2010.[3][4] It was included in the Guinness World Records as world's ""longest non-stop double track cable car.""[5]

Etymology
According to tradition, Tatev Monastery is named after Eustateus, a disciple of St. Thaddeus the Apostle, who preached and was martyred in this region. His name has evolved to Tatev.[6]

Folk etymology includes a legend telling of an event that is tied to the construction of the main church, where the builder falls down the abyss while completing the final structure of the dome, and during fall he calls ""Ta Tev"" meaning - give me wings. Folk legend says that he came down unharmed. where an apprentice secretly climbs to the top of its steeple intending to place a cross of his own design. However, the apprentice is spotted by his master during his descent. Shocked by his discovery, the apprentice loses his foothold and falls into the abyss as he calls upon God to grant him wings, which, in Armenian is: ""Ta Tev"".[7]

Tatev Monastery is located in South-East Armenia, in the area of ancient Armenian Syunik, not far from the city of Goris and 280 km away from Yerevan. The Tatev plateau has been in use since pre-Christian times, hosting a pagan temple. The temple was replaced with a modest church following the Christianization of Armenia in the 4th century.[7]

Development of the Tatev Monastery began in the 9th century when it became the seat of the bishop of Syunik. In his History of the Province of Syunik, historian Stepanos Orbelian describes the construction of a new church near the old one in 848 through the financial assistance of Prince Philip of Syunik. With the growth of economic and political importance of the centre, the aging buildings no longer suited its requirements, and thus Bishop Hovhannes (John) obtained the financial assistance of Prince Ashot of Syunik to construct the new monastery.[6]

In the beginning of the 11th century, Tatev hosted around 1,000 monks and a large number of artisans. In 1044, armed forces of neighbouring emirates destroyed the St. Gregory Church and its surrounding buildings, which were reconstructed soon after that. In 1087, the church of St. Mary was built to the north of the complex. The monastery suffered significant damage during Seljuk invasions in the 12th century and the earthquake in 1136. In 1170, Seljuk Turks plundered the Monastery and burnt some 10,000 manuscripts. The Monastery was rebuilt through the efforts of Bishop Stepanos near the end of the 13th century.[9]

The Monastery was granted an exemption from taxes during Mongol rule. It regained its economic strength with the assistance of the Orbelian family. Its influence grew further when, in 1286, the Orbelians assumed control of the monastery, Stepanos Orbelian was consecrated metropolitan and succeeded in reuniting a number of surrounding dioceses within its realm. With the establishment of the university in the 14th century Tatev became a principal centre of Armenian culture.[9]

During Timur lane's campaigns into Syunik (1381–1387), Tatev was looted, burnt, and dispossessed of a significant portion of its territories. The Monastery received an additional blow during Shah Rukh's invasion in 1434.[9]

The monastery was reborn in the 17th and 18th centuries; its structures restored and new ones were added. It was looted again during the incursions of Persian forces led by Aga Mahmet Khan in 1796.[9] In 1836, Czarist Russia put an end to the metropolitan authorities of Tatev through the imposition of Pologenia, and Syunik became part of the Diocese of Yerevan.[10]

On 26 April 1921, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress, held in Tatev, announced the independence of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia. The state included the regions of Tatev canyon, Sisian and Gndevaz. The city of Goris became the capital of the unrecognized state with Garegin Nzhdeh as its supreme commander.

The monastery was seriously damaged after an earthquake in 1931, the dome of the Sts. Paul and Peter church and the bell tower were destroyed. In the latter years the Sts. Paul and Peter church was reconstructed, but the bell tower remains destroyed up to today.

Buildings of the monastery

The fortified Tatev monastery consists of three churches - Saints Paul and Peter Church, Saint Gregory the Illuminator's Church, and the Holy Mother of God Church, a library, refectory, bell tower, mausoleum, as well as other administrative and auxiliary buildings.[9]

The church of Saints Paul and Peter was built between 895 and 906. An arched hall was added adjacent to the southern wall of the church in 1043. Soon after in 1087, the church of the Holy Mother of God was added along the northern fortifications. In 1295, the church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, which had been destroyed during an earthquake, was replaced with a new one through the initiative of then bishop Stepanos Orbelian. In 1787, the mausoleum of the Armenian theologian Gregory of Tatev was built adjacent to the western wall of the Church of Saint Gregory and by the end of 19th century a vestibule and a belfry were added at the western entrance of the church of Saints Paul and Peter.[9]

Aside from the buildings, the monastery boasts an upright pendulum, known as the Gavazan (staff). This column was built in the 10th century following the completion of the Paul and Peter church and has survived numerous invasions and earthquakes relatively unscathed.[9]

In the 14th century, fortifications were built to the south, west and north of the monastery with buildings for habitation, administration and other purposes. In the 18th century, additions were made to house the bishop's residence, cells for the monks, storage, dining hall, kitchen, bakery and winery. Sixteen rectangular classrooms, covered with arched ceilings, were built along the main fortifications.[9]

To the northeast of the monastery, outside of the fortifications is the olive press. It has four production rooms including two domed storage rooms and pressing chambers with arched ceilings. This mill is one of the best preserved in Armenia and is an excellent illustration of olive presses built in the region during the Middle Ages.[9]

The school buildings of the Tatev Monastery characterize the architectural style of monastic educational architecture used in the late medieval period.[9]";

Bodbe Monastery in 1905

Pilgrims at the St. Nino Spring.
According to Georgian tradition, St. Nino, having witnessed the conversion of Georgians to the Christian faith, withdrew to the Bodbe gorge, in Kakheti, where she died c. 338-340. At the behest of King Mirian III (r. 284-361), a small monastery was built at the place where Nino was buried. The monastery gained particular prominence in the late Middle Ages. It was particularly favored by the kings of Kakheti who made choice of the monastery as the place of their coronation. Pillaged by the troops of Shah Abbas I of Persia in 1615, the Bodbe monastery was restored by King Teimuraz I of Kakheti (r. 1605-1648). With the revival of monastic life in Bodbe, a theological school was opened. The monastery also operated one of the largest depositories of religious books in Georgia and was home to several religious writers and scribes.

After the annexation of Georgia by the Russian Empire (1801), the Bodbe monastery continued to flourish under Metropolitan John Maqashvili and enjoyed the patronage of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. In 1823, the monastery was repaired and adorned with murals. Upon John’s death in 1837, the Russian Orthodox exarchate active in Georgia since 1810 abolished the convent and converted it into a parish church. In the following decades, the monastery went into disrepair, but, in the 1860s, Archimandrite Macarius (Batatashvili) began to restore the monastery and established a chanting school. The chapel housing St. Nino’s relics were refurbished by Mikhail Sabinin in the 1880s. In 1889, Bodbe was visited by Tsar Alexander III of Russia who decreed to open a nunnery there. The resurrected convent also operated a school where needlework and painting was taught.

In 1924, the Soviet government closed down the monastery and converted it into a hospital. In 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Bodbe monastery was resumed as a convent. Restoration works were carried out between 1990 and 2000 and resumed in 2003.";

This is a truly iconic and highly significant site within the Georgian Orthodox Church and Georgian history.

Here's what makes Jvari notable:

Location: It's dramatically situated on a hilltop overlooking the city of Mtskheta (the ancient capital of Georgia) and the stunning confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers. This location provides breathtaking panoramic views.

Name Meaning: ""Jvari"" means ""Cross"" in Georgian. The monastery is named after a large wooden cross (or jvari) believed to have been erected on this spot in the 4th century by King Mirian III of Iberia after his conversion to Christianity through the efforts of Saint Nino, who is credited with bringing Christianity to Georgia.

History and Construction: The current stone monastery building was constructed later, primarily in the late 6th century AD (roughly 585/586 to 605 AD) by Prince Stephanoz I. It was built around the original wooden cross, which was later enclosed within the new stone structure.

Architectural Significance:

Jvari is considered a masterpiece of early medieval Georgian architecture.
It is an excellent example of a ""tetraconch"" church with corner niches, which creates a complex cruciform shape inside. This specific architectural plan was highly influential on later Georgian churches.
Its elegant proportions and harmonious design, combined with its prominent location, make it a visually striking building.
Religious and Historical Importance:

It stands on a site deeply connected to the initial conversion of Georgia to Christianity, making it a very important pilgrimage site.
It is one of the oldest standing Georgian churches.
Its construction marked a significant development in Georgian architecture and set precedents for future church building.
UNESCO World Heritage Site: Jvari Monastery is part of the Historical Monuments of Mtskheta UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for its outstanding universal value as a key example of medieval religious architecture in the Caucasus and its link to Georgia's conversion to Christianity.

Cultural Impact: The beautiful and strategic location of Jvari overlooking Mtskheta and the river confluence was famously described by the 19th-century Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov in his poem ""Mtsyri"" (The Novice), further solidifying its place in cultural consciousness.

In summary, Jvari Monastery is not just a church; it's a powerful symbol of Georgian Christianity, a stunning example of early medieval architecture, and a site of immense historical and cultural significance, offering one of the most iconic views in the country.";

Zedazeni is one of the oldest and most historically significant monastic foundations in Georgia, particularly important for the very beginnings of organized monasticism in the country.

Here's what's notable about Zedazeni in the medieval period:

Foundation and Early Medieval Roots (6th Century):

Zedazeni is traditionally considered one of the first monastic sites established by the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers who arrived in Georgia in the 6th century to strengthen Christianity and monastic life.
It was founded by Saint John of Zedazeni, the leader of this group, on Mount Zedazeni, a prominent peak overlooking the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers near Mtskheta (the ancient capital). This location had previous pagan significance, which was Christianized by the new foundation.
Significance as an Early Monastic Center:

As the base of Saint John, Zedazeni became the mother monastery for several other monastic foundations in Georgia. His disciples were sent out from here to establish monasteries elsewhere (like Shio Mgvime, David Gareja, Ikalto, Alaverdi, etc.).
This makes Zedazeni crucial for understanding the spread and organization of monasticism throughout Georgia from the 6th century onwards.
Role in Medieval Times:

Active Monastic Community: Throughout the medieval period, Zedazeni remained an active monastery, housing monks who followed the monastic rules established by the Assyrian Fathers.
Spiritual Pilgrimage Site: Due to the burial of Saint John within the monastery, it became and remained a significant pilgrimage site for Georgian Orthodox Christians throughout the Middle Ages.
Strategic and Defensive Role: Its location on a high, defensible mountain made it important strategically. It was often fortified and could serve as a refuge or observation post during times of invasion (which were frequent throughout the medieval period). The main church was likely adapted or built with defense in mind.
Architecture: The core structures, including the main church (likely rebuilt or modified over centuries), were built during the medieval period. Early Georgian monastic architecture often emphasized simplicity and solidity.
Challenges and Resilience:

Like many Georgian monasteries, Zedazeni faced challenges from various invasions during the medieval era (Arabs, Seljuks, Mongols, etc.). Despite potential damage or periods of hardship, the monastic tradition on the mountain endured.
In summary, Zedazeni Monastery during medieval times was fundamentally important as one of the original centers of Georgian monasticism, directly linked to the arrival of the Assyrian Fathers. It served as an active monastic community, a vital pilgrimage destination centered around the tomb of its founder, Saint John, and a strategically important fortified location on a prominent mountain, embodying the early spirit and resilience of the Georgian Orthodox Church.";

Archaeological sites were excavated starting in 1970 in the thirteen hills (maximum height 70 metres (230 ft)) around Khor Virap and up to the valley of the river. Excavations in hills 1 and 4, and sections of hills 5, 7 and 8 and of the neck of the land between Hills 1 and 2 are in progress.[21] Some archaeological excavations have also been carried out outside the walls of the church at the site of Artashat, the capital of the Tiridat dynasty.[22] In addition to ancient coins and potshards, excavations have unearthed well preserved mud-brick fortifications on the northern slope of the third hill from the northeast.[9] Khor Virap (Armenian: Խոր Վիրապ, lit. 'deep dungeon'[1]) is an Armenian monastery located in the Ararat Plain in Armenia, near the border with Turkey, about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of Artashat, Ararat Province, within the territory of ancient Artaxata.[2][3] The monastery was host to a theological seminary and was the residence of the Armenian Catholicos.[4]

Khor Virap's notability as a monastery and pilgrimage site is attributed to the fact that Gregory the Illuminator was initially imprisoned here for 13 years by King Tiridates III of Armenia. Saint Gregory subsequently became the king's religious mentor, and they led the proselytizing activity in the country. In the year 301, Armenia was the first country in the world to be declared a Christian nation.[2][5][6] A chapel was initially built in 642 at the site of Khor Virap by Nerses III the Builder as a mark of veneration to Saint Gregory. Over the centuries, it was repeatedly rebuilt. In 1662, the larger chapel known as the ""St. Astvatsatsin"" (Holy Mother of God) was built around the ruins of the old chapel, the monastery, the refectory and the cells of the monks. Regular church services are held in this church. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in Armenia.[6]

Etymology
The place of imprisonment ""virap nerk'in"", meaning the ""bottommost pit"", came to be known as the ""virap"" or ""khor (deep) virap"".[7]

Geography

Fenced border with Turkey
Khor Virap is located on a hillock in Pokr Vedi; the village is 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the main highway. Yerevan, the capital and largest city of Armenia, is 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the north. It is situated about 100 metres (330 ft) away from the closed Turkish-Armenian border (sealed by barbed wire fencing) and defended by Russian military establishments that guard the border zone.[5][8][9]

The monastery is surrounded by green pasture lands and vineyards within the Ararat plain and is in view of Mount Ararat. The Arax (or Aras) River flows close by, and the monastery is across from Aralık, Turkey.[10]

History

Plan of Khor Virap
King Artashes I, founder of the Artashesid dynasty, established his Armenian capital at Artashat (also known as Artaxtisata) around 180 BC. It is believed that Hannibal, the Carthaginian General who was persecuted by Rome, was also instrumental in establishing Artashat.[5] Artashat remained the capital of the dynasty till the reign of King Khosrov III (330–339) when it was moved to Dvin.[11] Subsequently, Artashat was destroyed by the Persian King Shapur II.[9] Artashat is close to the hillock of Khor Virap.[12] Until its chapel was built, Khor Virap was used as royal prison.


Baptism of Tiridates III by St. Gregory
When King Tiridates III ruled over Armenia, his assistant was the Christian Grigor (Gregory) Lusavorich who preached the Christian religion. However, Tiridates, a follower of pagan religion, was not pleased with having an advisor with a different religion, and he subjected Gregory to severe torture. When news reached the king that Gregory's father Anak the Parthian was responsible for the murder of the king's father, the king ordered that Gregory's hands and legs be tied and that he be thrown into the Khor Virap to die in the dark dungeon located in Artashat. In addition, Gregory's refusal to offer sacrifice to the goddess Anahita provoked the king to torture him and condemn him to imprisonment in the Khor Virap.[13] He was then forgotten and the King waged wars and persecution among Christian minorities.[14] However, Gregory did not die during his 13 years of imprisonment. His survival was attributed to a Christian widow from the local town who, under the influence of strange dream vision, regularly fed Gregory by dropping a loaf of freshly baked bread into the pit.[14]

During this period, the Roman Emperor Diocletian wanted to marry a beautiful girl, and sent agents to search for the most beautiful woman. They found a girl named Rhipsime in Rome, who was under the tutelage of Abbess Gayane in a Christian nunnery. When Rhipsime heard about the king's[clarification needed] marriage proposal, she fled to Armenia to avoid the marriage. A search was launched to locate the girl and punish the people who had helped her escape, and eventually Tiridates located Rhipsime and forcibly brought her to his palace. After unsuccessfully trying to woo her, he ordered that she be dragged into his presence by putting a collar around her neck in hopes to persuade Rhipsime to agree to marry him.[14]

However, what ensued was the persecution and murder of Rhipsime, Gaiane and many Christians. Tiridates went mad and is ""said to have behaved like a wild boar while torments fell on his household and demons possessed the people of the city"".[15][16] It was then that Tiridates's sister, Khosrovidhukt, had a vision in the night, where an angel told her about the prisoner Gregory in the city of Artashat who could end the torments with the words ""when he comes he will teach you the remedies for all your ills"".[14] People did not place much reliance on this vision, as most thought that Gregory had died within days of his being cast into the pit. But Khosrovidhukt had the same dream repeatedly, eventually threatened that if the dream's instructions were not followed, there would be dire consequences. Prince Awtay was deputed to get Gregory from Kirat Virap. He went to the pit and shouted to Gregory, saying ""Gregory, if you are somewhere down there, come out. The God whom you worship has commanded that you be brought out"". Gregory was brought out in a miserable state. He was taken to the king, who had gone mad ""foraging among the pigs at Valarshapar"", tearing his own skin. Gregory cured the king and brought him back to his senses. Gregory knew of all the atrocities committed, and saw the bodies of the martyrs who were later cremated. The king, accompanied by his court, approached Gregory, seeking forgiveness for all the sins they committed. Henceforth, Gregory started preaching Christianity to the king, his court, and his army.[14]

King Tiridates, who had embraced Christianity as his religion following the miraculous cure effected by Gregory's divine intervention, proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia in 301 AD. Gregory became the Bishop of Caesarea and remained in service of the King until about 314 AD.[11][16] Another version attributed to Tiridates's conversion to Christianity is that it was a strategic move to create national unity to checkmate the hegemony of Zoroastrian Persia and Pagan Rome, and since then, the Christian Church has acted as a strong influence in Armenia.[17]

Architecture

Church of the Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatzatzin)
Church
The Nerses chapel, built in the 7th century around the famous pit, was of white limestone.[4] Though plain in appearance, a monastery was built around a large enclosure that surrounds the ruins of the old chapel. This church, known as the Church of the Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatzatzin), has a twelve-sided tholobate and dome and is dedicated to S. Astvatsatsin. The altar pulpit is well decorated.[5][11] Though most Armenian churches have an east–west orientation, placing the altar at the east end, St. Gevorg Chapel is oriented northwest–southeast.[18]

Pit
The pit where Gregory was imprisoned is southwest of the main church, underneath St. Gevorg Chapel which is a small basilica replete with a semicircular apse.[18] Of the two pits inside the chapel, Grigor's is the farther one, 6 metres (20 ft) deep and 4.4 metres (14 ft) wide.[18] The pit is approached through two unmarked holes. A small chamber, winding stairway, and a ladder lead to a small enclosure in the pit. To the right of the altar in the dungeon is the main room. A long ladder from here descends to a large cell of fairly good size, which was Grigor Lusavorich's prison cell.[5] The climb down the well is to a depth of 60 metres (200 ft). The pit is well lit but the climb down the metal ladder requires sturdy shoes. It is also extremely humid down the pit in the summer months so be cautious and don't bring candles down as this adds to the heat.[19]

Grounds and surroundings

The monastery and the surrounding vineyards
The 17th century church built around the pit is a simple structure surrounding a large courtyard which looks like a fort complex.[2][6][11] In his 1876 book John Buchan Telfer wrote: ""the old Monastery of Khorvyrab surrounded by a wall, and looking very much like some old feudal castle.""[20]

Archaeological sites were excavated starting in 1970 in the thirteen hills (maximum height 70 metres (230 ft)) around Khor Virap and up to the valley of the river. Excavations in hills 1 and 4, and sections of hills 5, 7 and 8 and of the neck of the land between Hills 1 and 2 are in progress.[21] Some archaeological excavations have also been carried out outside the walls of the church at the site of Artashat, the capital of the Tiridat dynasty.[22] In addition to ancient coins and potshards, excavations have unearthed well preserved mud-brick fortifications on the northern slope of the third hill from the northeast.[9]

Culture
Celebration
The anniversary of the deliverance of Gregory is also celebrated in the Illuminator's cathedral built in Yerevan. On New Year's Day, light is brought from Khor Virap as a religious celebration.[23] In a recent event, Catholicos Garegin II climbed down the same deep prison pit where the first Catholicos Grigor had passed many agonizing years, and came out of the pit by holding a lighted candle as symbol of the light that illuminated Armenians several centuries ago.[24] As a pilgrimage centre, people visit Khor Virap for baptism or subsequent to a wedding to perform a matagh animal sacrifice.[25]";

Okay, let's delve into the David Gareja monastery complex during medieval times within the context of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

David Gareja is a vast and highly significant spiritual and cultural site in Georgia, and its medieval period represents its peak of activity and influence.

Here's what was notable about it in medieval times:

Foundation and Early Medieval Growth (6th Century onwards):

The complex was founded in the 6th century AD by Saint David Garejeli, one of the thirteen Assyrian Fathers who arrived in Georgia to strengthen Christianity.
It began as a handful of isolated hermit cells carved into the semi-desert rock face. This early period established its identity as a center of asceticism and rigorous monastic life.
Over the early medieval centuries (roughly 6th to 10th), the number of monks and the scope of the site grew significantly, developing into a complex of monasteries rather than just one.
Flourishing in the High Medieval Period (Georgian Golden Age, 11th-13th Centuries):

This was the height of David Gareja's influence. Under the patronage of powerful Georgian kings and queens, particularly during the reigns of figures like David the Builder and Queen Tamar, the complex expanded dramatically.
It became a major Lavra (a cluster of cells or caves under a central administration) and encompassed numerous separate monasteries spread across the rugged terrain (like Udabno, Lavra, Dodos Rka, Natlismtsemeli, etc.).
Spiritual Center: It was a renowned center for spiritual discipline, attracting ascetics and scholars. The monks followed a strict rule of life.
Cultural and Artistic Hub:
Frescoes: The monasteries became famous for their stunning and unique medieval wall paintings (frescoes) adorning the cave churches. These frescoes, dating from various medieval periods (especially 9th-13th centuries), are remarkable examples of Georgian monumental painting, blending Byzantine influences with local Georgian styles. They depict religious scenes, portraits of saints, and notable figures including royalty and abbots.
Scriptorium: David Gareja housed a highly active scriptorium where monks meticulously copied, illuminated, and translated religious manuscripts into Georgian. This made it a vital center for the preservation and development of Georgian literature, theology, and history.
Education: It served as an important center of religious and general education for monks and others.
Political and Strategic Significance:

Located in a frontier region on the border of the Georgian kingdom with various southern neighbors, David Gareja held strategic importance. It served as a symbol of Georgian presence and spiritual resilience in this area.
Its strategic location also made it vulnerable to invasions and raids throughout the medieval period from powers like the Seljuks.
Resilience and Challenges:

Despite its remote and harsh environment, the complex was remarkably self-sustaining. Monks developed sophisticated water collection systems and agricultural techniques adapted to the semi-desert.
However, its location made it a target. It suffered destruction and massacres during invasions in the medieval period, most notably by the Mongols in the 13th century, which caused a significant setback, though the complex was later partially restored.
In summary, during the medieval period, the David Gareja complex transformed from humble hermitages into a vast, influential spiritual, cultural, and artistic powerhouse of the Georgian Orthodox Church. It was celebrated for its strict asceticism, its invaluable collection of manuscripts, and its magnificent frescoes, standing as a testament to the flourishing of Georgian monasticism and culture during its Golden Age, despite the constant challenges posed by its frontier location.";

Earthquakes also did it no small damage.

It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with enhanced protection[1] status.

Now it is displayed in the Echmiadzin treasury.

The spectacular towering cliffs surrounding the monastery are part of the Azat River gorge, and are included together with the monastery in the World Heritage Site listing. Some of the churches within the monastery complex are entirely dug out of the cliff rocks, others are little more than caves, while others are elaborate structures, with both architecturally complex walled sections and rooms deep inside the cliff. The combination, together with numerous engraved and free-standing khachkars is a unique sight, being one of the most frequented tourist destinations in Armenia.

Most visitors to Geghard also choose to visit the nearby pagan Temple of Garni, located further down the Azat River. Visiting both sites in one trip is so common that they are often referred to in unison as Garni-Geghard.

The site is that of a spring arising in a cave which had been sacred in pre-Christian times, hence one of the names by which it was known, Ayrivank (the Monastery of the Cave).

Earthquakes also did it no small damage.

Though there are inscriptions dating to the 1160s, the main church was built in 1215 under the auspices of the brothers Zakare and Ivane, the Zakarid generals of Queen Tamar of Georgia, who took back most of Armenia from the Turks.[2] The gavit, partly free-standing, partly carved in the cliff, dates to before 1225, and a series of chapels hewn into the rock dates from the mid-13th century following the purchase of the monastery by Prince Prosh Khaghbakian, vassal of the Zakarians and founder of the Proshian principality. Over a short period the Proshyans built the cave structures which brought Geghard well-merited fame — the second cave church, the family sepulcher of zhamatun Papak and Ruzukan, a hall for gatherings and studies (collapsed in the middle of the 20th century) and numerous cells. The chamber reached from the North East of the gavit became Prince Prosh Khaghbakian’s tomb in 1283. The adjacent chamber has carved in the rock the arms of the Proshian family, including an eagle with a lamb in its claws. A stairway W of the gavit leads up to a funerary chamber carved out in 1288 for Papak Proshian and his wife Ruzukan. The Proshyan princes provided Geghard with an irrigation system in the 13th century. At this time it was also known as the Monastery of the Seven Churches and the Monastery of the Forty Altars. All around the monastery are caves and khachkars. The monastery was defunct, the main church used to shelter the flocks of the Karapapakh nomads in winter, until resettled by a few monks from Ejmiatsin after the Russian conquest. Restored for tourist purposes but now with a small ecclesiastical presence, the site is still a major place of pilgrimage.

The monastery was famous because of the relics that it housed. The most celebrated of these was the spear which had wounded Christ on the Cross, allegedly brought there by the Apostle Thaddeus, from which comes its present name, Geghard-avank (""the Monastery of the Spear""), first recorded in a document of 1250. This made it a popular place of pilgrimage for Armenian Christians over many centuries. Relics of the Apostles Andrew and John were donated in the 12th century, and pious visitors made numerous grants of land, money, manuscripts, etc., over the succeeding centuries. In one of the cave cells there lived, in the 13th century, Mkhitar Ayrivanetsi, the well-known Armenian historian.

No works of applied art have survived in Geghard, except for the legendary spear (geghard). The shaft has a diamond-shaped plate attached to its end; a Greek cross with flared ends is cut through the plate. A special case was made for it in 1687, now kept in the museum of Echmiadzin monastery. The gilded silver case is an ordinary handicraft article of 17th-century Armenia.

Complex

Entrance to the monastic complex
Today the monastery complex is located at the end of the paved road, and the walk up from the parking lot is lined with women selling sweet bread, sheets of dried fruit (fruit lavash), sweet sujukh (grape molasses covered strings of walnuts) and various souvenirs. A group of musicians usually plays for a few seconds as visitors approach, perhaps willing to play longer for money.

At the approach to the main entrance on the west there are small caves, chapels, carvings and constructions on the hillside. Right before the entrance are some shallow shelves in the cliff onto which people try to throw pebbles in order to make their wish come true. Just inside the entrance to the compound are the 12th–13th century ramparts protecting three sides of the complex, and the cliffs behind protect the fourth. Walking across the complex will take one to the secondary entrance on the east, outside of which is a table for ritual animal offerings (matagh), and a bridge over the stream.

The one- and two-storey residential and service structures situated on the perimeter of the monastery's yard were repeatedly reconstructed, sometimes from their foundations, as happened in the 17th century and in 1968–1971. It is known that most of the monks lived in cells excavated into the rock-face outside the main enceinte, which have been preserved, along with some simple oratories. The rock-faces over the whole area bear elaborate crosses (khatchkar) carved in relief. More than twenty spaces, varying in shape and size, were carved, at different levels, in solid rock massifs surrounding the main cave structures. Those in the western part of the complex were for service purposes, and the rest are small rectangular chapels with a semicircular apse and an altar. There are twin and triple chapels with one entrance, some of the entrances ornamented with carvings. There are many often richly ornamented khachkars cut on rock surfaces and on the walls of the structures or put up on the grounds of Geghard in memory of a deceased or in commemoration of someone's donation to the monastery.

Though there are inscriptions dating to the 1160s, the main church was built in 1215 under the auspices of the brothers Zakare and Ivane, the Zakarid generals of Queen Tamar of Georgia, who took back most of Armenia from the Turks.[2] The gavit, partly free-standing, partly carved in the cliff, dates to before 1225, and a series of chapels hewn into the rock dates from the mid-13th century following the purchase of the monastery by Prince Prosh Khaghbakian, vassal of the Zakarians and founder of the Proshian principality. Over a short period the Proshyans built the cave structures which brought Geghard well-merited fame — the second cave church, the family sepulcher of zhamatun Papak and Ruzukan, a hall for gatherings and studies (collapsed in the middle of the 20th century) and numerous cells. The chamber reached from the North East of the gavit became Prince Prosh Khaghbakian’s tomb in 1283. The adjacent chamber has carved in the rock the arms of the Proshian family, including an eagle with a lamb in its claws. A stairway W of the gavit leads up to a funerary chamber carved out in 1288 for Papak Proshian and his wife Ruzukan. The Proshyan princes provided Geghard with an irrigation system in the 13th century. At this time it was also known as the Monastery of the Seven Churches and the Monastery of the Forty Altars. All around the monastery are caves and khachkars.

It was a form of stylitism, though the ""pillar"" is a broad rock formation, not a narrow column.

Supporting Community at the Base: While the most famous aspect is the life on the pillar, there would have been a supporting community (perhaps just a few monks or lay helpers) at the base during the medieval period. They would have been responsible for hoisting supplies (food, water, building materials), communicating with the hermit, and potentially maintaining a church or chapel at ground level for broader worship.";"Georgian; Monastery ; Rati, a nobleman of the house of Liparitids (Baguashi) ; Liparitid (Baguashi) family ; 13.5 m. Katskhi Monastery (more accurately, the Katskhi Pillar and its associated monastic complex) within the context of the Georgian Orthodox Church during medieval times.

Katskhi is one of the most unique and visually striking religious sites in Georgia, renowned for its monastery perched atop a sheer limestone monolith.

Here's what's significant about it in the medieval period:

The Site: The core of ""Katskhi Monastery"" is the Katskhi Pillar (Katskhis Sveti), a natural limestone pillar rising about 40 meters (around 130 feet) from the surrounding valley floor in the Imereti region of Georgia, near the town of Chiatura.

Medieval Origins and Purpose:

Evidence suggests the pillar was used as a sacred site even before Christianity arrived, perhaps for pagan fertility rites.
With the spread of Christianity in Georgia, the pillar became a place of extreme asceticism. Hermits, seeking complete isolation from the world, climbed the pillar to live in solitude and devotion.
The main structures seen on top today – a small church dedicated to Maximus the Confessor, a crypt, three hermit cells, and a wine cellar – were built during the medieval period, likely in the 9th or 10th century. This indicates a more structured monastic presence, albeit a very small and exclusive one, existed on the pillar itself.
Style of Monasticism:

Life on the Katskhi Pillar was a form of stylitism (living on a pillar), although the pillar itself is not narrow like those associated with Syrian stylites. It was a radical expression of faith and detachment from earthly life, bringing the monk physically closer to God.
Monks would have lived in intense prayer, fasting, and contemplation, with necessities likely hoisted up using ropes.
Significance in Medieval Times:

Symbol of Extreme Faith: The Katskhi Pillar represented the ultimate pursuit of spiritual isolation and devotion within Georgian monasticism. It was a powerful symbol of the lengths to which ascetics would go.
Uniqueness: While other hermits lived in caves or remote places, living on top of such a prominent and inaccessible pillar was exceptionally rare and would have marked the site as extraordinary.
Part of a Larger Complex: There was likely also a church and possibly living quarters at the base of the pillar in medieval times, serving as a support community for the hermits on top and perhaps other monks in the area.
Decline and Abandonment:

The site was active throughout parts of the medieval period. However, like many remote monastic sites, it eventually fell into disuse and was effectively abandoned for centuries after the medieval era, possibly due to invasions or changing political/social conditions. The structures on top were not fully explored or documented again until the 20th century.
In essence, during medieval times, the Katskhi Pillar and its small structures served as an astonishingly unique and challenging monastic dwelling for Georgian Orthodox hermits. It wasn't a large scriptorium or a political powerhouse like some other monasteries, but rather a potent symbol of the most rigorous and isolated forms of spiritual discipline practiced within the Georgian Church.";

Katskhi Pillar and its significance for the Georgian Orthodox Church specifically during the medieval period again.

As we've discussed, during medieval times, the Katskhi Pillar served a very particular and unique role:

Site of Extreme Asceticism: It was a place for hermits seeking ultimate isolation from the world. Living atop the roughly 40-meter-high pillar was a radical form of monasticism within the Georgian Orthodox tradition, representing profound detachment and spiritual discipline.
Medieval Structures on the Pillar: Small structures were built on the summit in the 9th-10th centuries. These included a small church (dedicated to Maximus the Confessor), cells for hermits, a crypt, and a wine cellar – structures designed solely to support a minimalist, solitary, and devotional life.
Symbolic Importance: While not a large community or a center of learning like Gelati or David Gareja, the Katskhi Pillar was a powerful symbol of deep faith and the lengths to which Georgian ascetics would go in pursuit of holiness and closeness to God.
Supported by a Base Community: There would have been a small supporting community at the base in medieval times, helping the hermit(s) on the pillar with supplies and communication.
In essence, during the medieval period, Katskhi wasn't a typical monastery but a unique, highly challenging dwelling for solitary ascetics, recognized for its extreme form of spiritual practice and serving as a potent symbol within the Georgian Orthodox Church. It was active during this era before being abandoned for centuries.";
Chulevi Monastery;Georgian Orthodox;0;Saint Mary;1350;2025;675;Ottoman rule;Georgia;GEO;Adigeni;41,67527778;42,70583333;Male;nobility;;Church;personal research NY;;"The Chulevi monastery of St. George is a 14th-century Georgian Orthodox domed church located in the region of Samtskhe-Javakheti, in Adigeni municipality, at the left bank of the river Kvabliani, near the village Patara Zanavi.



History
The church is considered to be built in 1381. Scientists think that the word ""Chule"" in ancient Georgian meant deepened covered area. Currently, we only have saint George domed church from the initial complex.

The monastery is dated XIV century however, there was the place for prayers (Salotsavi) of Saint George before that. Stephane Chuleveli was known among the bibliophiles of the black mountain in Syria in the second half of the XI century. The nickname ""Chuleveli"" it is believed to be the initial place of martyrdom.

Aghbugha Atabeg (the hereditary title of nobility of a Turkic origin indicating a governor of a nation or province who was subordinate to a monarch) has organized the legislative meeting at Chule monastery and continued the work initially led by Beka I Mandaturtukhutsesi (Chief overseer of the court, in charge of the palace guard and matters of protocol). He issued the new book of the law. This book of the law is called ""The book of the law of Beka and Aghbugha"". After the Ottoman conquest of the area, the Chulevi monastery declined and had been completely abandoned by 1595. With the blessing of God and Archbishop Theodore (Chuadze), the monastery and monastic life have renewed in Chulevi.



Architecture
The monastery is the part of the religious architectural association of Saphara and Zarzma. The Chulevi monastery shares a series of common features with the contemporary and nearby located churches of Zarzma and Sapara such as the typically elongated overall plan and the interior space, rectangular shape with no projections, a dome resting upon the walls of the altar and two cross-shaped pillars. There are two alcoves in the alter. The church has twp entrance one from the west and second from the south. The church was painted by Arsen in the 1381 year. You can see the portraits of the several men on the south wall on the top of the entrance. Those are the members of the family of Jakel: Sargis-Saba, Beka I, Sargis II, kvarkvare I, Shalva (younger son of Beka). In other areas of fresco, there are revealed the parts of stories from the Holy Scriptures.";

Gelati Monastery (გელათის მონასტერი) during medieval times. This is arguably the most significant and multifaceted Georgian Orthodox monastery of the medieval period. It was far more than just a place of worship; it was a major center of spiritual, intellectual, cultural, and political life.

Here's what was notable about Gelati during medieval times:

Foundation and Vision (Early 12th Century):

Gelati was founded by King David IV (David the Builder) in 1106. David was the most powerful monarch of Georgia's Golden Age, and his vision for Gelati was grand.
He intended it to be a new spiritual and intellectual center for Georgia, a rival to major centers like Constantinople or Athos, and a symbol of the unified, strong Georgian kingdom.
Multiple Roles and Significance:

Major Monastic Community: It housed a large and important community of monks who followed a strict rule of life and engaged in daily prayer and worship in the grand cathedral and other churches.
Royal Necropolis: Gelati became the burial site for Georgian kings, beginning with its founder, David the Builder himself (his tomb is famously placed near the gate, where everyone entering must step over it). This established a profound link between the monastery and the Georgian state and monarchy.
Academic Center (The Gelati Academy): This is one of Gelati's most unique features. David established an academy here (often called the ""Gelati Academy"") which became a leading center of learning.
It attracted prominent Georgian scholars, theologians, and philosophers, many of whom had previously studied or worked in Byzantium or Mount Athos (like Ioane Petritsi and Arsen Iqaltoeli).
It was a hub for translating Greek philosophical and theological works into Georgian and fostering original scholarship. The aim was to elevate Georgian intellectual life to the highest contemporary standards.
Cultural and Artistic Hub:
Architecture: The main Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, built between the 12th and 13th centuries, is a masterpiece of medieval Georgian architecture. The complex also includes the Church of St. George and the two-storey Church of St. Nicholas.
Mosaics and Frescoes: Gelati is particularly famous for its stunning medieval mosaics, especially the large and beautiful mosaic of the Virgin and Child in the main cathedral's apse (early 12th century). It also contains numerous important medieval frescoes depicting saints, biblical scenes, and portraits of Georgian royalty and church figures. These artworks are prime examples of the high artistic standards of the Georgian Golden Age.
Scriptorium: Like other major monasteries, Gelati had an active scriptorium where manuscripts were copied, illuminated, and preserved, contributing significantly to Georgian literature and history.
Religious Authority: Gelati held immense prestige within the Georgian Orthodox Church. It became an autocephalous monastery directly under the Catholicos of Georgia and later was associated with the Catholicosate of Abkhazia/Western Georgia.
Height of Influence (12th-13th Centuries): Gelati flourished throughout the Georgian Golden Age, serving as a spiritual beacon, an intellectual powerhouse, and the symbolic heart of the Bagrationi kingdom's religious and political authority.

In summary, Gelati Monastery in medieval times was an unparalleled institution in Georgia. Founded by a king with a vision of national greatness, it combined the roles of a major monastic community, a royal burial ground, a leading academy of higher learning, and a center of artistic and architectural excellence. It wasn't just a monastery; it was the premier monastic, cultural, and intellectual heart of the Georgian Golden Age, profoundly intertwined with the identity and power of the medieval Georgian kingdom and the Georgian Orthodox Church. It is recognized today as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its outstanding universal value.";

Martvili Monastery (მარტვილის მონასტერი) and its role in the Georgian Orthodox Church during medieval times.

Martvili Monastery is a very significant site in Western Georgia, known particularly for its beautiful cathedral. Its medieval history is rich and reflects the region's importance within the Georgian realm.

Here's what was notable about it during the medieval period:

Location: Situated on a hill overlooking the town of Martvili in the Samegrelo region (historical Mingrelia), Western Georgia. This location gave it prominence in that part of the kingdom.

Pre-Christian Roots: The site had religious significance even before Christianity. It was a place of pagan worship centered around a sacred oak tree associated with fertility. This pre-Christian layer is important context.

Early Christian Foundation (7th Century): The first Christian church is traditionally believed to have been built here in the 7th century, replacing the pagan shrine after the sacred tree was cut down. This established its identity as a Christian site early in the medieval period.

Medieval Peak and Reconstruction (10th-11th Centuries): The most significant medieval phase for Martvili dates to the late 10th and early 11th centuries.

Major Cathedral Construction: The impressive main church, the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, which stands today, was largely rebuilt during this period, likely after suffering damage from Arab invasions. Its architecture is characteristic of the developed cross-in-square plan common in medieval Georgian church architecture.
Royal Patronage: This reconstruction is associated with the Bagrationi dynasty, particularly King Bagrat IV (reigned 1027–1072) and his mother, Queen Mariam, who were significant patrons. This link to the ruling family underscored its importance.
Eparchial Seat: Martvili became the seat of a bishopric (Eparchy), giving it significant administrative religious authority over a large area of Western Georgia. It later even became the seat of a Catholicos of Abkhazia/Western Georgia, further elevating its status.
Role as a Spiritual and Cultural Center:

Pilgrimage Site: As a major cathedral and monastic complex dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was a key pilgrimage destination in Western Georgia.
Monastic Community: It housed a community of monks who engaged in prayer, worship, and the upkeep of the complex.
Likely Educational Role: While not as famous for its scriptorium as Gelati or Ikalto, major medieval monasteries like Martvili typically played a role in preserving and copying manuscripts and educating clergy.
Architecture and Art: The medieval cathedral itself is the primary artifact from this period. Its architecture and any surviving medieval frescoes or decorative elements reflect the artistic styles and religious iconography of the time.

In summary, during medieval times, Martvili Monastery transformed from an early Christian foundation on a former pagan site into a major spiritual, administrative, and cultural center in Western Georgia. Its peak came in the 10th-11th centuries with the construction of its prominent cathedral under royal patronage and its establishment as a key bishopric. It was a vital part of the Georgian Orthodox Church's structure and influence in the western part of the kingdom.";

Currently the monastery houses a number of ancient relics, which include a manuscript copy of the Book of the Gospels written around 1280; Egre-muk (or wooden-cuffs), a huge pot which ancient monks used to cook, and other 13th century objects.

Another prized relict is an icon of the Christ child sitting on his mother's knees, known as ""The One Who Listens"", which the monks believe is miraculous. Created in the 15th century, the icon was cleaned and repaired by a British charity, The Ethiopian Heritage Fund in 2010, and subsequently was housed in a special museum as the monastery.[4]";"History
The monastery is responsible for producing five people, known as ""Lights"" (or important sources of knowledge and Christian salvation) of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. One of these Lights was Saint Tekle Haymanot, who was educated in this monastery, and helped to convert Shewa and other southern provinces by ministering and building churches.

Istifanos Monastery was looted by Imam Ahmad Gragn in 1531, who, upon coming upon the lake ordered the Arabs in his ranks to construct boats to reach the island. The first boats constructed, which were made out of wood beams bounded by cords, proved unsatisfactory; one of the Imam's followers suggested tying air sacs made of cow's skins to each raft, and this allowed the Imam's forces to sail across the lake to the monastery. Seeing that they were now defenseless, the monks of the monastery surrendered their valuables to prevent the destruction of their home.";

This is a very significant historical and religious site in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

Here's what's notable about it:

Location: It is located in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia, on the northern shore of Lake Tana, near the town of Gorgora. It's situated in a historically rich area known for its numerous ancient monasteries around and on the islands of Lake Tana.

Name Meaning: ""Tsadkane Mariam"" translates roughly to ""Mary of the Righteous"" or ""Mary of the Saints,"" indicating its dedication to the Virgin Mary.

Historical Significance:

Ancient Foundation: Like many monasteries around Lake Tana, its origins are ancient, though specific founding dates can be debated. It gained particular prominence during the Gondarine period (starting in the 17th century).
Royal Connections: It is often associated with Emperor Fasilides (reigned 1632–1667), the founder of Gondar, who is said to have shown favor to the monastery or been involved in its patronage. This link highlights its importance within the kingdom at the time.
Center of Learning and Preservation: Tsadkane Mariam was historically a vital center for religious education and the preservation of religious texts and artifacts.
What it's Known For:

Ancient Manuscripts: The monastery is renowned for its collection of ancient Ge'ez manuscripts. These manuscripts, often beautifully illuminated, are priceless historical and theological treasures. They cover various topics, including scriptures, liturgical texts, patristic writings, and historical chronicles.

Architecture: Features traditional Ethiopian church architecture, likely including circular or rectangular churches built in local styles.
Current Status: Tsadkane Mariam is an active monastery housing monks who continue the daily routines of prayer, study, and preservation of the site's heritage. It is a site of pilgrimage for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians and attracts visitors interested in history, art, and religion.

In summary, Tsadkane Mariam Monastery is a major historical and spiritual landmark on the northern shore of Lake Tana, known for its ancient roots, royal connections, and particularly for its invaluable collection of Ethiopian manuscripts, making it a crucial site for understanding the history and culture of the Ethiopian Church. Tsadkane Mariam Monastery (ጻድቃኔ ማርያም) is another important and ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery. The name translates to ""Righteousness of Mary"" or ""St. Mary of the Righteous Ones."" It is often located in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, an area rich in ancient Christian heritage.

Like Debre Abbay, its activities during medieval times (and continuing to the present) would have been deeply rooted in the traditions of Ethiopian Orthodox monasticism.

Here's a breakdown of the likely activities at Tsadkane Mariam Monastery:

Prayer and Liturgy (ፀሎትና ቅዳሴ - Tselotna Kidase):

Divine Office (Sa'atat - ሰዓታት): The absolute heart of monastic life. Monks would gather for communal prayer multiple times throughout the day and night (typically seven times). This involves chanting Psalms, hymns (from the Deggwa, Tsome Deggwa, Me'eraf, Zimare by St. Yared), and reciting extensive prayers in Ge'ez.
Divine Liturgy (Kidase - ቅዳሴ): The celebration of the Eucharist. This would be performed regularly, often daily in larger monasteries, with great solemnity and devotion. The Ethiopian Liturgy is one of the oldest Christian liturgies.
Vigils and Night Prayer: Common, reflecting a commitment to constant prayer.
Marian Devotion: Given its name, Tsadkane Mariam would have a particularly strong devotion to the Virgin Mary (Kidanä Mehret - ""Covenant of Mercy,"" or a specific Marian feast day). Special hymns and prayers dedicated to St. Mary would be prominent.
Sacred Music: Chanting (zema) accompanied by traditional liturgical instruments like the sistrum (tsenatsil), drums (kebero), and prayer staffs (mekwamiya).
Study and Scribal Work (ትምህርትና ጽሕፈት - Timihirtina Tsihifet):

Scriptural Study: Deep engagement with the Holy Scriptures. Monks would spend considerable time reading and meditating on the Bible.
Hagiographies (Gadle - ገድለ): Studying the lives of Ethiopian saints, martyrs, and desert fathers. The Gadle of the Virgin Mary (if such a text exists or is a focus) and other prominent saints would be important.
Theological and Patristic Writings: Study of traditional Ethiopian theological works, commentaries, and writings of the Church Fathers.
Manuscript Copying: Monasteries like Tsadkane Mariam were vital centers for preserving knowledge by meticulously copying sacred texts by hand onto parchment (branna). This included Bibles, liturgical books, hagiographies, theological treatises, and chronicles.
Illumination: Many of these manuscripts would be beautifully illuminated with intricate designs and religious iconography.
Teaching (Timihirt Bet - ትምህርት ቤት): Serving as a center of learning. Senior monks would teach novices and younger monks in scriptural interpretation, liturgical practice, Ge'ez language, and church doctrine. It could attract students from surrounding areas.
Manual Labor (ሥራ - Sira):

Self-Sufficiency: The monastery aimed to provide for its own needs.
Agriculture: Cultivating crops such as teff, barley, wheat, lentils, and various vegetables, often on terraced land if in a mountainous region.
Animal Husbandry: Raising cattle, sheep, goats, and chickens.
Beekeeping: Honey was an important food source and used for making traditional beverages.
Crafts:
Weaving cotton or wool for monastic habits and other textiles.
Making simple tools, pottery, or baskets.
Basic carpentry for maintaining buildings and making furniture.
Maintaining the Monastery: Repairing and building cells, the church, enclosure walls, and other structures.
Asceticism (ተጋድሎ - Tegadlo):

Fasting: Adherence to the rigorous fasting schedule of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (many days throughout the year, abstaining from animal products and often from all food and drink for part of the day).
Simplicity of Life: Living with minimal possessions, simple food, and basic clothing.
Discipline: A life structured by obedience, prayer, and spiritual discipline.
Spiritual Guidance and Pastoral Care (መንፈሳዊ መመሪያ - Menfesawi Memriya):

Abbot (Memhir - መምህር): The head of the monastery, providing spiritual leadership and guidance.
Confession and Counsel: Senior monks would hear confessions and offer spiritual advice to other monks and to laypeople who visited the monastery.
Prayers for the Faithful: The monks would pray for the needs of the wider church and community.
Healing: People often sought out monasteries for prayers for healing and deliverance.
Hospitality (እንግዳ መቀበል - Ingida Mekebel):

Providing food, shelter, and care for pilgrims, travelers, and those in need was a fundamental monastic virtue.
Artistic Production:

Manuscript Illumination: As mentioned, this was a key artistic activity.
Church Decoration: The monastery church might have been adorned with religious paintings (murals or icons) depicting scenes from the Bible, the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and saints.
Tsadkane Mariam Monastery would have been a significant spiritual center, embodying the deep piety, rich liturgical traditions, and commitment to learning and asceticism characteristic of Ethiopian Orthodox monasticism. Its specific dedication to St. Mary would have made it a particular focal point for Marian devotion in its region.";

The monastery dates from the 14th century, and has important connections with Ethiopian history: the Battle of Debre Abbay was fought nearby 14 February 1831; and notable Ethiopian scholars, such as Gedamu Woldegiorgis, continued to be educated there well into the early to mid-1900s.[1] Okay, Debre Abbay (ደብረ ዓባይ) is indeed a significant and ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery. The name ""Debre"" means ""mountain"" or ""monastery"" (often on a mountain), and ""Abbay"" can refer to the Blue Nile River (Abay) or simply mean ""great."" This particular Debre Abbay is generally associated with Abuna Samuel of Waldebba (or Samuel of Dabra Wagag/Debre Abbay), a highly revered Ethiopian saint who lived around the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It's located in a remote area, often associated with the Tigray region.

Monasticism is a cornerstone of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with roots going back to the 4th-5th centuries and the arrival of the Nine Saints.

Here's what activities at Debre Abbay would have been like, especially during its medieval flourishing and in line with general Ethiopian Orthodox monastic traditions:

Prayer and Liturgy (ፀሎትና ቅዳሴ - Tselotna Kidase):

Divine Office: The absolute core of daily life. Monks would gather multiple times a day and night (often 7 times, mirroring Psalm 119:164) for communal prayer, chanting Psalms, hymns (like those of St. Yared - Deggwa, Tsome Deggwa, Me'eraf, Zimare), and reciting extensive prayers. This is known as Sa'atat (Hours).
Divine Liturgy (Kidase): The celebration of the Eucharist, often daily or several times a week. The Ethiopian liturgy is ancient, conducted in Ge'ez (the liturgical language), and known for its length and solemnity.
Vigils and Night Prayer: Common, especially in more ascetic communities.
Use of Sacred Music: Chanting (zema) is integral, often accompanied by traditional instruments like the sistrum (tsenatsil), drums (kebero), and the use of prayer staffs (mekwamiya) for rhythm and support during long services.
Study and Scribal Work (ትምህርትና ጽሕፈት - Timihirtina Tsihifet):

Scriptural Study: Deep engagement with the Holy Scriptures (Ethiopian Orthodox canon is one of the largest).
Hagiographies (Gadle): Reading and studying the lives of saints, which are numerous and highly influential in Ethiopian spirituality. Abuna Samuel's own Gadle would be central.
Theological Commentaries and Patristic Writings: Study of traditional Ethiopian theological works and Church Fathers.
Manuscript Copying: Monasteries were vital centers for copying sacred texts by hand onto parchment (branna). This preserved scriptures, liturgical books, hagiographies, and theological works. This was a highly skilled and sacred art.
Teaching: Senior monks would teach novices and younger monks. Some monasteries became renowned centers of learning, attracting students from afar.
Manual Labor (ሥራ - Sira):

Self-Sufficiency: Monasteries aimed to be self-sufficient.
Agriculture: Cultivating crops like teff, barley, wheat, and vegetables, often in terraced fields if in mountainous areas. Animal husbandry (cattle, sheep, goats, chickens).
Beekeeping: Honey was important for food and making tej (honey wine, though monks would be more ascetic).
Crafts: Weaving cloth for monastic habits, making tools, pottery, basic carpentry.
Maintaining the Monastery: Building and repairing cells, the church, and other structures.
Asceticism (ተጋድሎ - Tegadlo):

Fasting: Extremely rigorous and frequent. Ethiopian Orthodox Christians observe many fasting days (around 180-250 per year for devout laypeople, even more for monastics). This involves abstaining from meat, dairy, eggs, and often from food and water entirely for parts of the day.
Solitude and Hermit Life: While Debre Abbay was a communal monastery, the tradition of Abuna Samuel of Waldebba often emphasizes asceticism. Some monks might have sought periods of greater solitude in nearby caves or hermitages. Waldebba itself is a region renowned for its extreme asceticism.
Simplicity of Life: Minimal possessions, simple food, and coarse clothing.
Spiritual Guidance and Pastoral Care (መንፈሳዊ መመሪያ - Menfesawi Memriya):

Confession and Counsel: The abbot (Memhir - መምህር) and senior monks provided spiritual guidance to the community and to laypeople who visited.
Healing: Monasteries were often places people turned to for prayers for healing (physical and spiritual).
Blessings and Intercession: Monks were seen as powerful intercessors.
Hospitality (እንግዳ መቀበል - Ingida Mekebel):

Providing for pilgrims, travelers, and those seeking refuge was an important monastic duty.
Artistic Production:

While some monasteries were famous for icon painting or church murals, the primary artistic output of many, including those in the Waldebba tradition, would be the beautifully illuminated manuscripts.
Unique Aspects of Debre Abbay (Abuna Samuel):

Its connection to Abuna Samuel of Waldebba would mean a particular emphasis on ascetic discipline, rigorous prayer, and potentially a more secluded, remote lifestyle reflecting the spirit of the Waldebba monastic region, which is known for its ""desert fathers"" ethos.
The monks would strive to emulate the life and virtues of their founder, Abuna Samuel.
Debre Abbay, like other ancient Ethiopian monasteries, would have been a beacon of faith, learning, and cultural preservation, playing a vital role in maintaining the traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church through centuries of often turbulent history.

When Paul B. Henze visited the monastery in 2001, he described it as flourishing and self-sufficient, inhabited by 80 monks, 12 nuns, and ""30-odd"" priests.[2]";

He was told at the time that the building had been built by Prince Gabra Masqal, a son of Emperor Kaleb, in 560.[5]

Beatrice Playne visited the monastery around 1950 and found that the church had burned down twenty years prior and had been rebuilt before her arrival. Nevertheless, she was shown several prized possessions which were centuries old, including a number of illuminated manuscripts ""whose ornamental headings struck me as Syrian in style.""

The family of the fifth Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Abune Paulos, was long associated with the Abune Garima monastery. It was at this monastery that the Patriarch first took monastic vows as Abba Gebre Medhin.

The name comes from the surrounding Holy Mountains; the Holy Dormition is another term for the death of the Virgin Mary.

The monastery is near the town of Sviatohirsk (so named for the monastery in 2003), in Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. The monastery also forms the centrepiece of the Holy Mountains National Nature Park (established 1997). The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) proclaimed it a lavra in 2004. The first written mention of the monastery dates from 1627, although Sigismund von Herberstein had alluded to the ""Holy Mountains"" area as early as 1526. It is likely that the first monks settled the area in the 15th century. At the time it was a minor monastic establishment in the Wild Fields regularly ravaged by the Crimean Tatars.

In 1787, Catherine II had it shut down. The monastery's lands were secularized and donated to Prince Grigory Potemkin, the Viceroy of New Russia. One of his heirs, Alexandr Mikhailovich Potemkin, and his wife Tatiana, née Princess Galitzine, financed the monastery's restoration, starting in 1844.

Soviet closure
Before the October Revolution, the Sviatohirsk Monastery owned a worker's shop, windmills, various kinds of repair shops, and trading buildings. The lavra's main Dormition Cathedral was designed by Alexey Gornostaev, who included a traditional Byzantine tower. From 1917 onward, the Bolsheviks plundered and desecrated the monastery on numerous occasions, beating and murdering many monks and in 1922, they shut the monastery down completely, setting up a Sanatorium for the Donbas workers on the grounds.[1]

Before World War I, the monastery was inhabited by approximately 600 monks. During the 1930s, some of the churches were demolished by the Soviets, along with other numerous religious sites throughout the Soviet Union. Sviatohirsk Lavra, located in the Donetsk region of Ukraine on the Siversky Donets River, is a very significant monastery today, but its prominent history and status as a Lavra are primarily associated with later periods, not the medieval era in the same way as monasteries like St. Michael's in Kyiv or the large royal foundations in Serbia.

Here's a breakdown:

Location: Situated on chalk cliffs along the Siversky Donets River in what is now eastern Ukraine. This area was on the frontier of Kyivan Rus' and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth/Russian territories, often subject to raids and conflicts.
Period (Traditional vs. Documented):
Tradition: Legends and traditions suggest that monastic life in the Sviatohirsk caves could date back as early as the 11th or 13th century, possibly founded by monks fleeing the Mongol invasion of Kyivan Rus' or other troubled regions.
Documented History: The earliest reliable historical written records mentioning the monastery date from the 16th century. While monastic activity might have existed in the caves before that, the existence of a structured, organized monastic community with significant activities typical of larger medieval monasteries is not well-documented or archaeologically proven for the deep medieval period (i.e., before the 15th century). The monastery significantly developed in the 17th century and had its major flourishing in the 19th century.
Nature in Early Times (Speculative): If monastic life did exist in the caves in medieval times, it was likely focused on hermitage, asceticism, and deep seclusion. The location is remote and naturally suited for solitary spiritual practice rather than functioning as a large administrative or cultural center.
Regarding ""Ukrainian Orthodox"" in medieval times:

As mentioned before, the term ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" in its modern, distinct sense didn't exist in the medieval period. The church in Kyivan Rus' was part of the broader Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Any early monastic activity at Sviatohirsk, if it existed, would have been within this unified Orthodox tradition of the Rus' lands.

Regarding Activities in medieval times (based on speculation about early cave dwellers):

Given the likely nature of early monasticism in the Sviatohirsk caves, activities would have focused primarily on:

Prayer and Asceticism: Intense personal prayer, fasting, and spiritual discipline in the solitude of the caves.
Hermitage: Living as hermits, perhaps forming very small, informal communities.
Survival: Focused on finding sustenance in a remote location.
Limited Interaction: Very little interaction with the outside world compared to accessible monasteries.
Conclusion:

While Sviatohirsk Lavra has a venerable tradition of monastic life potentially stretching back to the medieval period via cave hermits, it is not considered a major, well-documented medieval monastic center with the kind of significant cultural, artistic, intellectual, or political activities seen in monasteries like those in Kyiv, Serbia, or other well-established medieval Orthodox centers. Its historical prominence and status as a Lavra belong largely to the post-medieval era, particularly from the 16th century onwards and its major revival in the 19th century. There is limited concrete evidence to describe extensive or typical medieval monastic activities at this specific location during the medieval period itself.";

   Although within the archbishopric of Akkar, the monastery is directly attached to the Patriarchate of Antioch. Located in the governorate of Homs and the local district of Tell Kalakh, it lies midway between Homs and Tripoli, on the edge of the Wadi al-Nasara, the Valley of the Christians’. This is the northernmost extension of the BekaaValley and forms a strategic passage from inland Syria to the Mediterranean coast. Since ancient times, traders and soldiers have passed through this fertile region. When the Crusaders conquered it, they were struck by the abundance of camel herds that pastured its green fields. Several springs rise from the hills west of the monastery and flow into two lakes watering the convent garden, where the monks cultivate all kinds of vegetables. One of these springs also supplies the monastic wells through a drainage system.

   The place-name al-Homeyra was known in antiquity, and an ancient temple once existed beside the monastery. In Aramaic, hamaïra means ""powerful"" and ""invulnerable"". Alternatively, the name may designate the fertile reddish soil of the surrounding area. The existence of both the pagan temple and the monastery at this site is connected to the miraculous spring of Fawar, formerly known as the Sabbatical River, which rises from a nearby cave. According to tradition, the spring runs only on Saturdays, and so it was described by the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius (37-100AD) in his description of Titus’ return journey to Rome after his victory over the Jews in 70AD (Jewish War, 7:96). Long before, in 1990BC, the Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I, father of Ramses II, had built a fortress called Sheptun, ‘Saturday’ in ancient Egyptian, on the site of the Krak des Chevaliers.

   The Monastery of St George al-Homeyra remains an important place of pilgrimage. Christians come to it from all over the Orthodox world, including Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Greece, Russia, and the West. Particularly large numbers of believers come at Epiphany and the two annual feast-days of the monastery, St George on 6th May  and the Feast of the Cross on 14th September, in order to baptize their children, especially the first.

 

History
   Owing to the lack of historical and archeological witness, the date of the monastery's foundation cannot be fixed. It was traditionally founded in the early Christian period (fourth-sixth centuries). The Arab historian al-Tabari (839-923) mentions the monastery under the title of ‘Our Lord al-Khodr Abu l-Abbas’. The Crusaders, who occupied this region for about two centuries, left no record of the monastery. Yet, the old monastery church was probably built in the Crusader period, and there must have been relations between the monastery and the Krak des Chevaliers. The monastery’s history becomes better known during the Ottoman period, and sources become abundant in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.    ";

The particularity of this Deir is that it belonged to Mar Maron, the founder of the Maronite Church. It is believed that he built it with his followers as a refuge, and lived and worked there, sometime between the 2nd and 4th century AD.

It is a modest monastery formed of three levels with rock stairways, small cells, and several altars.The cavern is situated 90 metres (300 ft) above the river. It consists of three levels with rock stairways, numerous altars, and small cells, suggested to have been the residence of Saint Maron and his early followers in the fourth century CE, during the foundation of the Maronite Church. It is suggested that Maron worked and even died in the monastery. Later occupation in Mamluk and Ottoman empire periods is attested by loopholes cut into the walls.[2][4] The monastery is commonly thought to have been constructed by Romans, however the date, builders and origins of the structure are not certain.[1]

The structure has fallen into disrepair, having been used as shelter for sheep, goats, and the occasional shepherd over the years.[5] The cavern is located on land owned by the Ministry of Energy and Water of Lebanon, but has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the Maronite Archdiocese and the Dandash family, who stake an old claim on the land. The Maronite Archdiocese has retained rights to renovate the landmark and has stated intentions to begin a restoration project. The site has only reported to have been cleaned and no work has started on the monument, suggested to be of ""national"" importance.[1]

It is noteworthy to pinpoint that historians Della Volpe and D'Ambrosio think that the structure built by the Romans in the second century was not a refuge but a defense fortification of the fertile Beqaa valley (colonised by Roman veterans in Pagus Augusti and in Heliopolis) against the Persian attacks from the north.

This amazing three-level cave/monastery is cut into sheer rock that is more than 90 meters high. The site is made up of an altar, staircase and small cells carved from the rock. According to some historians, Roman engineers were the first to inhabit the site in the second century, staying in an opening they carved into rocks while they worked to irrigate the surrounding areas.In the fourth century, Saint Maron, a Syriac monk, is said to have inhabited the cave.L.T.[6]

It is suggested that Maron worked there (with many disciples, including: James of Cyrrhus, Limnaeus, Domnina, Cyra, Marana, Abraham the Hermit) and even died in the monastery.

Even if greatly damaged during Arab conquest of the region, later occupation in Mamluk and Ottoman empire periods is attested by loopholes cut into the walls.[2][7] The monastery is commonly thought to have been constructed by Romans, however the date, builders and origins of the structure are not certain.[1]";

Origin
The date that the Templars first took possession of the fortress is unknown, but it is known that the fortress was previously occupied by the de la Roche family.[2]

Legend states that in 1188, Saladin placed the castle under siege because Jean Gale,[3][a] a knight against whom he sought revenge, was there. Years prior, Gale had been excommunicated from the Christian community for murder and had found refuge with Saladin in Muslim territory. Saladin charged Gale with the education of his nephew, but wanting to regain his standing among the Christians, Gale turned over Saladin's nephew to the Templars, driving Saladin to vengeance. Saladin may have taken Roche-Guillaume, but news from Palestine that King Guy de Lusignan had led knights into Tripoli as forebears of the Third Crusade brought an early end to his siege of the castle.[2]

In 1203, the king of Lesser Armenia took the castle, but it was reclaimed by the Templars in 1237, around the same time as they launched a campaign to recapture the castle of Trapessac, located about 15 kilometers away. Roche-Guillaume was reconquered by the Muslims in 1298–99, when the sultan of Egypt sent an army to invade northern Syria. The castle of Servantikar was also seized in the campaign.[2]

In 1298 or 1299, the military orders—the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller—and their leaders, including Jacques de Molay, Otton de Grandson and the Great Master of the Hospitallers, briefly campaigned in Armenia, in order to fight off an invasion by the Mamluks.[5][6][7] However, they were not successful, and soon, the fortress of Roche-Guillaume, the last Templar stronghold in Antioch, was lost to the Muslims.[5]

Location and Characteristics
The authors have disagreed with the exact location of this castle.[8] According to Paul Deschamps, it would be Çalan Kalesi,[9] but Claude Cahen argued that Çalan might be Roche de Roissel, another Templar castle.[10] However, they all agreed to place it in the Amanus, on the border of what was the Principality of Antioch and Lesser Armenia. Others placed it further east, on a plateau at 1,250-metre (4,100 ft) rocky precipice above the plain of Karasu Çayı, near the Euphrates. The castle also controlled the road that led to Antioch and the plain below.

Today, little remains of Roche-Guillaume but ruins. These, however, show that the constructors of the fortress used the rock upon which the castle was built as a cut foundation. The castle's remains suggest that the structure may be Byzantine in origin, or at the very least it was maintained at some length by the Byzantines.

The best-preserved portion of the fortress is the chapel, which was common in fortresses of military orders. The presence and current state of the chapel further suggests Byzantine custodianship.";

It was then rebuilt about 1153 by the Knights Templar[4] under the name Gaston (also Gastun, Guascon, Gastim) and held by them or by the Principality of Antioch until it was forced to capitulate to Saladin on 26 August 1189. It was retaken in 1191 by the Armenians (under Leo II), and their possession of it became a major point of contention between them and the Antiochenes and Templars.[4] The castle remained under Armenian control until 1215, when it was taken back by the Templars who held the castle until the 1268 conquest of Antioch.[6]

According to the Armenian chronicle of Sempad the Constable, around 1229 Bagras withstood a siege by Al-Aziz, the emir of Aleppo, and his cavalry.[7] After Baibars besieged and conquered Antioch in 1268, the garrison lost heart, and one of the brothers deserted and presented the keys of the castle to him. The remaining defenders decided to destroy what they could and surrender the castle. The brothers then fled to the nearby Templar stronghold of La Roche Guillaume before leaving to Acre to confess their abandonment and subsequent loss of the castle. It was decided that the brothers would not be expelled from the order, but would face the next harshest punishment of losing their habits for a year and a day. The record of this trial survives in a late thirteenth century Catalan copy of the Rule of the Templars.[6] Despite the loss of the castle, Hethum II, King of Armenia and Leo IV, King of Armenia soundly defeated a Mamluk raiding force in the nearby pass in 1305.[8]

The first detailed historical and archaeological evaluation, including a surveyed plan of the entire complex, was completed in 1979 by R. W. Edwards.[9] The fortification has more than thirty chambers which encompass the steep outcrop on three primary levels. Although the site initially had phases of Arab and Byzantine construction, most of the exterior masonry is from the Frankish occupations. Repairs to the towers and walls were made by the Armenians with their distinctive masonry during brief periods of control. Bağras was never integrated into the complex defensive system that the Armenians built along the Taurus and Anti-Taurus Mountains of Cilicia from the 12th through the 14th centuries.[10]";

It was built by the Knights Templar during the Crusades upon prior fortifications. Located on the middle hill of Safita's three hills, it offers a commanding view of the surrounding countryside, and was a major part of the network of Crusader fortifications in the area. From the roof, a view ranging see from the Mediterranean Sea to the snow-covered mountains of Lebanon, and County of Tripoli, is offered. From Chastel Blanc it would have been possible to see the Templar strongholds at Tartus and Ruad Island to the northwest, Chastel Rouge on the coastline to the southwest, Akkar to the south, and Krak des Chevaliers (the headquarters of the Syrian Knights Hospitallers) to the southeast.

History
The region was initially controlled by the Crusaders by 1110, and was mentioned the first time in an Arab chronicle in 1112.[1] The Knights Templar built a dungeon after 1117,[1] then they possessed the tower by 1152.[2] Later on, the tower was attacked by Nur ad-Din in 1167,[1] to be recaptured by the Templars in the same year,[3] and was rebuilt after the 1170 earthquake, then in 1188 after Saladin's invasion,[4] and after the 1202 earthquake.[1] The tower was eventually captured and destroyed by Baibars in 1271.[5]

The tower served both as a chapel and a fortress, with 3 metres (9.8 ft) thick walls constructed of massive and carefully fitted limestone blocks. The ground floor still contains a chapel, dedicated to St. Michael and used by the Greek Orthodox community of Safita. The second floor, which can be reached by a flight of partially destroyed stairs, served as a dormitory, and contains many small angled windows that were used by archers to defend the tower. Cut into the rock below the tower is a water cistern and a former weapons cache, essential elements in case of siege.

From the other fortifications of the castle, only a portal at 45 metres (148 ft) to the east of the keep can still be seen today. During the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, efforts were made to restore the tower, causing great discomfort to the villagers that lived very close to it.

In 1946, when the castle's keep threatened to collapse, architect Pierre Coupel undertook an intensive programme of repairs.[6]

Structure
The structure base dates back to the Phoenician era.[7] However, the tower visible today is the remaining keep of the original castle. It has a height of 28 metres (92 ft), a width of 18 metres (59 ft), and a length of 31 metres (102 ft). A large bell is on the western wall, and its sound can be heard up to 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Safita. The castle had to be restored in 1170 and 1202 following damages due to earthquakes. The keep in its current shape probably dates from the reconstruction after 1202.";

It is also identified as Castrum Rubrum mentioned in Latin texts. The castle stands in the village of Yahmur, at 12 kilometres' distance from Tartus and 10 kilometres from Safita, where the Tortosa and Chastel Blanc Crusader castles can be found.

History
Little is known about the capture and early development of the place by the Crusaders. This is because it was a castle of secondary importance, and also to some doubts in identifying the castle in medieval sources. However, it was granted by Tancred to Pons, Count of Tripoli in 1112. Later on, the stronghold seems to be in the hands of a Frankish family, the Montolieu, vassals of the Counts of Tripoli. Thus, it was part of the network of castles defending the County, for example Crac des Chevaliers, Chastel Blanc and Areimeh.

In 1177/78, Raymond III transferred the stronghold to the Hospitallers,[1] and the Montolieus were given 400 bezants as compensation.[2] In 1188, Saladin attacked the stronghold and destroyed it. The Crusaders could most probably retrieve it and keep it until they lost the County one century later, during the reign of Mamluk sultan Qalawun in 1289.

Description of the place
The village of Yahmur is located in the coastal plain between Tartus and Tripoli. Consequently, Chastel Rouge did not possess natural defences, as many other castles did.

The stronghold consists in a two-floor donjon, 16 metres long and 14 metres wide, enclosed in rectangular outer walls of 42 metres' length and 37 metres' width, with towers on the north-western and south-eastern angles. The first floor was divided in two storeys by a wooden floor that does not exist any more. Upper floors can be reached through stairs running along the walls inside and outside the donjon.

The construction cannot be dated with exactitude, however two main phases can be recognised: the first phase dates from the beginning of the 12th century and includes the outer walls, while the donjon was built at the beginning of the 13th century.

Excavations in the stronghold also found ruins date back to the Phoenician era, in addition to inscriptions from the Greco-Roman period.[3]";

It is the oldest of the Maronite monasteries, the first center of eremitic life in Lebanon, and served from 1440 to 1830 as the See of Maronite Patriarch. Medieval Times and Activities at a Maronite Monastery like the one in Mayfouk:

Maronite monasteries in medieval Lebanon were vital centers of religious life, culture, and community survival, especially during periods of instability or persecution.

Prayer and Liturgy (Core Activity):

Divine Office: Monks would gather for the daily cycle of prayers (Shimo in Syriac), chanted in Syriac, the liturgical language of the Maronite Church.
Holy Qurbono (Divine Liturgy/Mass): Regular celebration of the Eucharist.
Personal Prayer and Contemplation: Individual monks would also dedicate significant time to private prayer, meditation, and spiritual reading.
Agriculture and Self-Sufficiency:

Monasteries were often endowed with land (waqf). Monks, with the help of lay workers or tenant farmers (often from the surrounding Maronite villages), cultivated the land.
Crops: Wheat, barley, olives (for oil), grapes (for wine used in liturgy and for consumption), figs, and vegetables.
Animal Husbandry: Raising goats, sheep, and perhaps some cattle for milk, cheese, meat, and wool.
Terracing: Given the mountainous terrain of Mayfouk, extensive terracing would have been necessary for agriculture.
They aimed for self-sufficiency in food and other basic necessities.
Scriptorium and Preservation of Culture:

Monasteries were crucial for copying religious texts, liturgical books, theological works, and chronicles in Syriac and Arabic. This was vital for preserving Maronite religious and cultural heritage.
Some monks would have been skilled scribes.
Limited education might have been provided to novices or young men from local communities.
Refuge and Community Center:

During times of conflict or persecution (e.g., under Mamluk or later Ottoman rule), monasteries served as places of refuge for the local Maronite population.
They were centers of identity and community cohesion, where traditions were maintained and passed down.
The monastery church would often serve the spiritual needs of nearby villages.
Hospitality:

Offering lodging and food to travelers, pilgrims, and the poor was a traditional monastic virtue.
Spiritual Guidance and Pastoral Care:

Monks, especially priests among them, provided spiritual direction, heard confessions, and offered counsel to the laity.
Episcopal or Patriarchal Seat (Significance of Mayfouk):

Crucially, Mayfouk (specifically Our Lady of Mayfouk) served as a residence for the Maronite Patriarchs at various times, especially from the 12th to the 15th centuries, though often alternating with other locations like Yanouh or the Qadisha Valley.
This meant the monastery would have also been an administrative center for the Maronite Church, hosting synods, receiving dignitaries, and issuing decrees. The presence of the Patriarch would have elevated its importance significantly.
Simple Crafts:

Monks might engage in simple crafts needed for the monastery: making sandals, simple furniture, pottery, or tools.";

It is located around 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the Mediterranean coast and approximately 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) south of Baniyas. The castle remained in a poor state of preservation until 2007 when some reconstruction and renovation began.

Fortress
History
Margat is located on a hill formed by an extinct volcano about 360 metres (1,180 ft) above sea level on the road between Tripoli and Latakia, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

According to Arab sources, the site of Margat Castle was first fortified in 1062 by Muslims[1] who continued to hold it within the Christian Principality of Antioch in the aftermath of the First Crusade. When the Principality was defeated at the Battle of Harran in 1104, the Byzantine Empire took advantage of their weakness and captured Margat[a] from the Muslims. A few years later it was captured by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, regent of Antioch, and became part of the Principality.

In the 1170s, it was controlled by Rainald II Masoir of Antioch as a vassal of the count of Tripoli. The fortress was so large that it had its own household officials and a number of rear-vassals. Rainald II's son Bertrand sold it to the Hospitallers in 1186 as it was too expensive for the Mazoir family to maintain. After some rebuilding and expansion by the Hospitallers it became their headquarters in Syria. Under Hospitaller control, its fourteen towers were thought to be impregnable.

In 1188, Saladin marched on Margat having left Krak des Chevaliers in search of easier prey. According to Abu'l-Fida, ""Recognising that Maqab was impregnable and that he had no hope of capturing it, he passed on to Jabala"".[3] It was one of the few remaining territories left in Christian hands after Saladin's conquests.

By the beginning of the 13th century the Hospitallers controlled the surrounding land and roads and made a large profit from travellers and pilgrims passing through. Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus was imprisoned there after Richard I of England captured Cyprus from him during the Third Crusade. The bishop of nearby Valenia also used Margat as his headquarters after around 1240. Margat was second in size and power only to the other Hospitaller fortress to the south, Krak des Chevaliers.

In September 1281, the Hospitallers of Margat dispatched a contingent of troops to support the Mongol invasion of Syria, which the Mamluk sultan of Egypt Qalawun successfully prevented after defeating the coalition at Homs. To punish the Hospitallers, Qalawun clandestinely raised an army in Damascus and besieged Margat on 17 April 1285. After a 38-day siege during which sappers and miners managed to dig several tunnels underneath the fortress's walls, a mine destroyed a salient of the southernmost wall. The defenders panicked and on discovering the numerous tunnels around the fortress, surrendered to the Mamluk commander Fakhr al-Din Mukri on 23 May, with Qalwun entering Margat two days later. The siege was witnessed by eleven-year-old Abu'l Fida and his father, the Ayyubid governor of Hama. Qalawun allowed the Hospitallers to leave with everything they could carry. Rather than destroy Margat as he did with other fortresses, he repaired its defences and placed a strong garrison there due to its strategic value.[4]

Marqat, known as Marqab by the Muslims, became a district of the Mamluk province of Tripoli with maintenance of the area financed by the sultan. Intrepid traveller Ibn Battuta visited the fortress and noted that a suburb was built outside of it for foreigners, who were not allowed entry into the fortress. The district governor based at the Marqab fortress held the military rank of ""Emir of 20 Mamluks."" He was charged with defending the coast, particularly from threats from the island of Cyprus, and maintaining the guard towers and observation posts. During the Burji Mamluk period, Margat was well known in the region for containing an imperial prison with many high-profile inmates. The 15th-century Muslim historian Khalil al-Zahiri noted that Marqab fortress was among the most important sites of Tripoli province. Marqab was ""clearly impregnable and controls a territory containing numerous villages.""[4]

During the Ottoman era, Margat became the administrative center of a kaza (""district"") of the same name, which contained three nahiyas (""subdistricts"") — Margat, Qadmus and Khawabi. In the 1890s there was a total of 393 localities with a collective population of 39,671, of whom 21,121 were Alawites. The chief agricultural products were olives, onions, tobacco and silk, which were largely marketed to Beirut-based merchants. The fortress served as the residence of the kaymakam (""military governor"") of the district until 1884 when the seat was transferred to Baniyas.";

The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.

The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' ""golden age"". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 the Mamluk Sultanate captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the knights to surrender.

Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.

Today, the village of al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.[1] It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.[2]

Etymology
""Krak"" is derived from karak, the Syriac word for a walled city or fortress.[3] Before the arrival of the crusaders, the local Arab ruler had established a fortification on the site manned by Kurds, giving it the name, in Arabic, of Ḥoṣn al-Akrād (حصن الأكراد), or ""fort of the Kurds"".[4] Following the construction of the present castle, the crusaders (whose elite spoke either Old French or, in Tripoli, possibly Old Occitan[5]) corrupted that name into Le Crat and then, as a result of confusing it with karak, the name evolved into Le Crac.[6]

Because of its association with the Knights Hospitallers, it was known as Crac de l'Ospital (Fortress of the Hospital) during the Middle Ages.[7] The name was later romanticised[8] to become Krak des Chevaliers in French in the 19th century,[9] meaning ""Fortress of the Knights"".[4]

Location

Krak des Chevaliers overlooking the surrounding area
The castle sits atop a 650-metre-high (2,130 ft) hill east of Tartus, Syria, in the Homs Gap.[10] On the other side of the gap, 27 kilometres (17 mi) away, was the 12th-century castle of Gibelacar (Hisn Ibn Akkar).[11] The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of Tripoli and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range, and to the south, Lebanon. The surrounding area is fertile,[12] benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall.[13] Compared to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.[14]

Property in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.[13]

Origins and Crusader period
According to the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Shaddad, in 1031, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo and Homs, Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr, established a settlement of Kurdish tribesmen at the site of the castle,[15] which was then known as ""Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ"".[16] Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids' access to the coast of Tripoli after they lost nearby Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimids in 1029.[16] Due to Nasr's garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as ""Ḥiṣn al-Akrād"" (Fortress of the Kurds).[15][16] The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the Jibal al-Alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli.[15] When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.[17]

In January 1099, on the journey to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers.[18] The following day, Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site.[19] The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains, and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.[20]

The origins of the order of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but it probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order that cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many Crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s, the order became militarised[21] when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136.[22] A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, that offered protection to pilgrims.[21]

Between 1142 and 1144 Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted property in the county to the order.[23] According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a ""palatinate"" within Tripoli.[24] The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state, which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Further, Raymond II could not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers.[23] The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.[25]

After acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel.[26] In 1163, the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.[27]

Drought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent.[28] In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands.[29] The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards, Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states.[30] After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli.[31] In May 1188, Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle, decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.[32]

Another earthquake struck in 1202, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.[33]

Cutaway section of the Krak from south to north
The first half of the 13th century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers' ""golden age"". While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271, and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King Andrew II of Hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the ""key of the Christian lands"". He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the Master and 40 to the brothers. Geoffroy de Joinville, uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades Jean de Joinville, died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle's chapel.[34]

The main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders, although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to pay tribute to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203, the garrison was making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.[32]


The area between the inner and outer walls is narrow and was not used for accommodation.
In the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252, after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268, Master Hugues Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000 people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.[35]

As for Hugues Revel, some of the castellans of this castle are identified: Pierre de Mirmande (Grand Commander) and Geoffroy le Rat (Grand Master).[citation needed]

Baibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271, Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle, the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3 March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers.[36] By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days.[37] Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege, only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, who was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived, he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.[38]

Rain interrupted the siege, but on 21 March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29 March, the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner, causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward, they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission, (aman), for them to surrender on 8 April 1271.[39] Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives.[38] The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward.[40] The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs (prayer niches) were added to the interior.[41]

Later history

During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the castle housed a company of local janissaries and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hisn al-Akrad, attached first to the Tripoli Sanjak and later Homs, both part of the Tripoli Eyalet. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area, and in the 18th century the district was mainly controlled by local notables from the Dandashi family. In 1894, the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of auxiliary soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result, the capital of the district was then moved to nearby Talkalakh.[42]";

Late in the 13th century, at Our Lady Monastery in Hamatoura, Saint Jacob began his ascetic life. Later, when the monastery was destroyed by the Mamlukes, he reestablished monasticism along the perimeter of the ruined monastery. In time, he rebuilt the monastery, regenerating and giving renewed vigor to monastic life in the area. His spiritual briskness, vivacity, and popularity among believers drew the attention of the Mamelukes who set their minds to stop his verve and determination and force him to convert to Islam. He stubbornly refused their relentless pressures. The Mamlukes killed him and burned the church. Today, believers and pilgrims are constantly reporting his apparitions, miraculous healings and other Grace-filled deeds.";

Coliath or ""La Colée"" - a francization of the non-Arabic al-Qulai'a, ""the little fortress"", the fort, plural al-Qulai'at, the forts - was given by Count Pons of Tripoli to the Hospitaller order in 1127.

It was then reoccupied by the Franks, but it was the Mamluk sultan Baibars who, in the summer of 1266, completely ruined it as a prelude to the capture of Tripoli.

Its defensive role was mediocre, so it was generally used as a dwelling for a troop in the field in times of war, as a base for economic domination in times of peace, or more simply as a place of refuge against raiders. The plan of its construction is that of a castrum (enclosure castle) similar to that of several other sites fortified by military orders in the region. It is a square enclosure flanked by towers, housing on its reverse side large vaulted multifunctional halls. Comparative examples include the inner enclosure of the citadel of Belvoir overlooking the Jordan Valley, the first enclosure of the Krac des Chevaliers, and the more modest enclosures of Qalaat Yahmour and Umm Hosh.";

This beautiful, small church dates to 1121 AD. There’s a tradition that the Monastery of Our Lady of Elij took the place of one of the train stations of the Roman road from Baalbak and the banks of Al Assi River to the North coast of Phoenicia. The apostles used this road during their trips between Antakya and the beaches of Palestine, and turning the place into a Christian one is attributed to them. (The apostles and students of St. Lucas). The name of Elij is derived from the word “Eel”, from the Aramaic language, and it means “God of soft valley”. But from the Greek, it is derived from the word “Ellios” meaning “Goddess of the Sun”. According to a Syriac inscription on the church wall (1277 AD.): “In the name of the eternally living God, in the year 1588 of the Greek era, this Jacobi temple was built for the Mother of God who prays for us, by the bishops Mark and John, in 1588 of the Greek era.” A cross was also engraved with a Syriac state “In You we conquer our enemy and in your name, we tread our haters”. There’s Syriac writing on the monastery’s wall: “In the name of the living God, in 1746 A.D, the two monk- brothers Amoun & Ming. It was established by four patriarches Botros, Ermia, Yaacoub, and Youhanna in 1121 A.D”. The church is known for its ”Elij” icon of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ: while restoring it in 1985, Sisters of karlmalite-Harissa, researchers had found 10 different layers of paint, and the oldest one backed to the 10th century (every layer is over 100 year). This monastery is the fourth oldest belonging to the Maronites. It is one of the most ancient Episcopal seats in Lebanon. It was built on the ruins of a pagan temple as mentioned before. It had witnessed all types of persecution and martyrdom for the name of Jesus Christ, in addition to the history and faith, in what it spared miracles and glorification of Virgin Mary. It is not an edifice, but it looks like a grotto, built in the valley amidst old trees, between the mountains and the rebellious course of two rivers, of soil-colored dabachi stones which cannot easily be seen under the walnut trees… What is left of the monastery today are two floors. The church occupies the greatest part of the ground floor while the first floor contains a small loft and a wide hall. The patriarch lived on the upper floor, in the small loft, which can be reached either by an internal flight of stairs within the church, or by external stone stairs. There is also a secret access from the patriarch’s room to another hidden room or to the outside. A small window was opened in the patriarch’s room facing the Holy Sacrament and the icon of Our Lady of Elij over the main altar. Next to the church on the first floor, there are two rectangular rooms with low curved ceilings, open to each other by a small path on the west side, inside the separating wall. The church is distinguished by its “Bema” (the throne in Greek), with stairs leading to it on the western side. The bema is a high tribune in the church where the first part of the Mass, the Liturgy of the Word, is celebrated, where the Patriarch sit with bishops. It is the only church in Lebanon that still keeping a bema. There are a number of basements (narrow tunnels) inside the walls used to hide and run during persecution, invasion and war. There is a library containing souvenirs: religious relics, photos, books, documentary, local products.;

Beaufort Castle, Lebanon;Knights Hospitallers;;Saint John the Baptist;1260;1268;8;Ottoman rule;Lebanon;LBN;Arnoun;33,3333;35,5333;Male;knights;;Crusades;personal research NY;;"Beaufort or Belfort Castle, known locally as Qal'at al-Shaqif (Arabic: قلعة الشقيف, romanized: Qalʾāt al-Shaqīf)[1] or Shaqif Arnun, is a Crusader fortress in Nabatieh Governorate, Southern Lebanon, about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-south-east of the village of Arnoun. There was a fortification on the site before it was captured by Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in 1139 and construction of the Crusader castle probably began soon after. Saladin captured Beaufort in 1190, but 60 years later Crusaders re-took it. In 1268 Sultan Baibars finally captured the castle for the Islamic forces.

Beaufort provides one of the few cases in which a medieval castle proved of military value and utility in modern warfare as well, as its late 20th-century history, especially during the 1982 Lebanon War, shows.

Name
The castle was named bel fort or beau fort (French for ""beautiful fortress"") by the Crusaders who occupied the castle in the 12th century. Its Arabic name Qala'at al-Shaqif means ""Castle of the High Rock"" (shqif is the Aramaic word for ""high rock"").[citation needed]

History
Medieval era
The outcrop Beaufort occupied overlooks the Litani River.[2] The river flows past the east side of the castle, which stands atop a 300 metres (980 ft) cliff which declines steeply to the river.[3] Little is known of the site prior to its capture by Crusader forces in 1139, as no contemporary documents mention the site before then. However, historians assume that the castle's commanding hilltop site made it a strategic position that was fortified before its capture by the Crusaders.[4] Fulk, King of Jerusalem, captured the fortification of Qal'at al-Shaqif in 1139 and gave the site to the lords of Sidon. Medieval historian Hugh Kennedy speculates that construction of the Crusader castle began soon after Fulk gave the site to the lords of Sidon.[3]


The castle in the 1871–77 PEF Survey of Palestine
Saladin defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. In the aftermath, many castles and cities fell to Saladin's forces so that only a handful of cities remained under the Crusaders' control. Beaufort was one of the last castles to resist Saladin.[5] In April 1189, Saladin was preparing to besiege the castle and Arab sources describe the event in detail. At the time Beaufort was under the control of Reynald of Sidon who had survived the Battle of Hattin. While Saladin was camped at nearby Marjayoun, preparing for the siege, Reynald met him and claimed to have Muslim sympathies. He said that while he would like to hand over control of Beaufort, his family were in the Christian city of Tyre and he could not surrender until they were safely out of the city. In the hope of a taking the castle without any bloodshed, Reynald was given three months to extract his family from Tyre; instead he used this time to repair the castle and stock up on supplies.[6]

After three months Reynald met Saladin again, protesting he needed more time. Saladin insisted he hand over the castle immediately, so Reynald ordered the garrison to surrender. When they refused Reynald was taken prisoner and the siege began.[6] Hostilities lasted until August that year when Saladin was forced to lift the siege to defend Acre.[7] In April 1190 an agreement was reached where the castle's garrison would hand over control to Saladin in return for Reynald's release.[6] The castle came under Crusader control in 1240 as part of a treaty negotiated by Theobald I of Navarre. It was sold to the Knights Templar by Reginald's grandson, Julian of Sidon, in 1260.[8] In 1268, the Mamluke Sultan Baibars captured the castle, and there was relative calm through the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.[4]";

Beautifully restored, built into the vertical cliff wall, is exceptionally impressive. The date of its first settlements is unknown. What is known:

Starting the 14th century, is was the residence of the Maronite bishops. In the 17th century, a French man from Aix-En-Provence nobility  called Francois de Chasteuil decided to live there as a hermit. He died from tuberculosis in 1644 and is now buried there. The Maronite order was founded in this monastery between 1698 and 1700. The last hermit of Mar Lichaa, Antonios Tarabay, died in 1998 and is now almost worshipped by some believers.

Mar Lichaa Monastery houses a very interesting find which remains a mystery until today - The Black Slab. A medieval sign of Christianity in the Orient is engraved in it, it's not a fish, but a geometrical form representing God in its center, a cross and the four Evangelists (take a look at the photo below). What's fascinating about it is that it bears inscriptions in the Syriac language, written in Estrangelo script which was commonly used in Lebanon mainly before the 12th century. Most likely, the slab was brought by the monks from Aleppo and dates back to a period older than the oldest archaeological evidence in Mar Lichaa.";

Pope Tawadros II The House of Zacchaeus the Publican

The bought site is above all notable for the fact that it was here that the house of the repentant tax-collector Zacchaeus stood. This is what the Gospel tells us about him: And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who He was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him: for He was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received Him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That He was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost (Lk. 19:1-10). he tomb of Venerable Cyriacus the Hermit

As a result of excavations carried out on this site columns of a sixth-century Byzantine church along with the mosaic headstone of Venerable Cyriacus were discovered. A chapel in honor of St. John, the Holy Prophet, Forerunner and Baptizer of the Lord, was erected in order to preserve the tomb.



    
“The altar of our church stands on the grave of Venerable Cyriacus the Hermit—the greatest fifth-century saint,” Sister Anna (Garmider), the dependency’s senior nun, relates. “For 1,500 years the Lord has kept the mosaic above his head along with the Greek epitaph, reading that here rests the grave of the Venerable Presbyter Cyriacus, ‘who built this church’. And we discovered another mosaic when we planted trees. This place was marked on old maps as the Lavra of Cyriacus the Hermit.”



    
The plot of Zacchaeus was returned to the Russian state by the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in 2000. Then there were stables in the pilgrims’ hostel, which in the nineteenth century had even accommodated visitors from the Imperial House, and dirty streams from the first floor (that had been added to the chapel) flowed down through a hole right to the tomb. Metropolitan Theeodosius of Tambov and Rasskazovo, who then headed the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, with the help of his assistants cleared up and put things in order at the plot. Services were resumed at the chapel and the hotel’s restoration was begun.

“Recently a new gate was installed, and a pavement along the hotel’s façade and a fence around the building were made. We could only dream of this before,” Nun Anna continues. “Earlier, merchants used to hang their goods right on our walls and windows; we had to turn on the light in the day time. We couldn’t open a window because someone from outside might stretch out his hand and say hello to us. And now even our façade is illuminated at night, so today the hotel resembles old Moscow.”

Among the forthcoming works are the restoration of the chapel’s frescoes and a number of separate buildings of the dependency. “There are vaulted ceilings there, small rounded windows, iron ornaments on wood—these are very beautiful and their spirit of antiquity gives you comfort,” Sister Anna recounts.

“The fresco of Venerable Cyriacus inside the chapel, to the left above the table of oblation, along with the whole west wall of the church are very vulnerable to mold growth. We cannot restore them because then whole layers start crumbling away. Damp-proofing is needed first of all,” the nun explains. The budgeted cost of the work scheduled is $80,000. “We should preserve this plot and beautify it for pilgrims among whom there may be another Zacchaeus, who first was a chief tax collector but later became Bishop of Caesaria in Palestine, an apostle, and eventually was martyred for Christ,” Nun Anna added.

It was built on the slopes of the Mount of Temptation 350 meters above sea level, situated along a cliff overlooking the city of Jericho and the Jordan Valley. Its most ancient structures date back to the 6th century, having been built above the cave traditionally said to be that where Jesus spent forty days and forty nights fasting and meditating while he was tempted by Satan.[1][2]

It currently serves as a tourist attraction and its land is under the full jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority, while the monastery is owned and managed by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.[3]

History
Hellenistic period
A fortress built by the Seleucids called ""Doq"" stood at the summit of the mountain. It was captured by the Hasmoneans and it was here that Simon Maccabaeus was murdered by his son-in-law Ptolemy.[4]

Byzantine period
The earliest monastery was constructed by the Byzantines in the 6th century CE above the cave traditionally said to be that where Jesus spent forty days and forty nights fasting and meditating during the temptation of Satan,[1][2] about three kilometers northwest of Jericho. The monastery receives its name from the mountain which the early Christians referred to as the ""Mount of the Temptation"". The Mount of Temptation was identified by Augusta Helena of Constantinople as one of the ""holy sites"" in her pilgrimage in 326 CE.[5]

Early Muslim period
Palestine, including Jericho, was conquered by the Arabs under the Islamic Caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab in the 630s.

Crusader period
When the Crusaders conquered the area in 1099, they built two churches on the site: one in a cave halfway up the cliff and a second on the summit.[3] They referred to the site as Mons Quarantana (compare with quarante in modern French and quaranta in modern Italian, both meaning forty, the number of days in the Gospel account of Jesus's fast).[5][4]

Late Ottoman period
The land upon which the modern monastery was built was purchased by the Orthodox Church in 1874. In 1895, the monastery was constructed around a crude cave chapel that marks the stone where Jesus sat during his fast.[3][1][4]

The Orthodox Church, along with its Palestinian Orthodox followers purchaser,[dubious – discuss] originally attempted to build a church at the summit, but were unsuccessful; the unfinished walls of that church are located on a slope above the monastery.[4]";

Il s'agissait d'une abbaye de moniales cisterciennes fondée en un lieu nommé Barbanisart, puis transférée cinq ans et demi plus tard en un autre lieu nommé Saulchoir, en fait à Kain, au nord de la ville de Tournai, en Belgique, dans la province de Hainaut.

Juridiquement, cette abbaye dépendait de l'abbaye de Citeaux. Elle ne fut jamais très prospère et fut même souvent endettée. Elle disparut à la suite des troubles de la période révolutionnaire. Les quelques moniales ont été expulsées et les bâtiments vendus comme biens nationaux.

Des pères dominicains français en exil ont occupé les lieux de 1904 à 1939 et en ont fait leur maison de formation théologique.

Histoire
Origine de la communauté religieuse
L’obituaire de l’abbaye prend un soin particulier à faire mémoire des généreux fondateurs, et donnent ainsi, à proximité du Melles, le récit des origines de l’abbaye : « L’an du Verbe Incarné 1233, fut fondé le monastère du Sart en un lieu nomme Barbarnisart des biens de Jean, dit Aletack, bourgeois de Tournay, et d’Agnès son épouse, lesquels pour former dans les bonne mœurs à la vie religieuse, selon la règle de Saint Benoît et la discipline de Cîteaux, les personnes qui à l’avenir voudront se consacrer à Dieu, choisirent treize religieuses au monastère de Braille et les amenèrent au jour de la Circoncision de Notre-Seigneur au dit lieu Barbarnisart. Les dits Jean et Agnès disposant d’une partie de leurs biens qui Dieu leur avait donnes, concédèrent à perpétuité au nouveau monastère, en terre manse et revenus la valeur de plus de deux cents livres tournois, sans que leurs héritiers puissent s’opposer à ces libéralités.

Implantation de l'abbaye et positionnement juridique
La communauté demeura en ce lieu (Barbarnisart) environ cinq ans et demi, après quoi elle fut transférée le jour de la Nativité de la Sainte Vierge Marie l’an de Notre-Seigneur 1238 en un autre lieu appelé Saulchoir et l’église fut consacrée sous le vocable de Notre-Dame du Sart »[1].

Guillaume IV de Montaigu, abbé de Cîteaux décide de la position juridique de l’abbaye : elle sera maison-fille de Braille, dans le diocèse d'Arras (qui devra donc fournir des religieuses) mais juridiquement, elle dépendra directement de l’abbaye de Cîteaux dont l’abbé fera la visite canonique prescrite par la Charte de Charité cistercienne.

Pauvreté de l'abbaye
Par choix de vie pauvre ou destin, l’abbaye du Saulchoir ne fut jamais très prospère. Durant les cinq siècles et demi de son histoire elle connaît la pénurie et est souvent endettée. Lors du siège de Tournai, en 1708, le duc Louis de Bourgogne loge au Saulchoir et est ému du sort des religieuses au point d’écrire aux magistrats de Tournai : «Je vous écris cette lettre pour vous faire connaître que la vertu et la régularité des religieuses de Saulchoir m’engagent à leur accorder ma protection. Le séjour que je fais dans leur monastère m’a donné lieu d’apprendre qu’elles sont pauvres. Vous êtes à portée de les aider et de les secourir dans leurs besoins, par des plaisirs que vous pourrez faire. Soyez sûr que j’aurai agréables tous les services que vous leur rendrez ; je ne doute pas que vous ne vous y portiez volontiers par les preuves que j’ai de votre zèle et attachement pour moi. Je suis, camp du Saulchoir, le 13 octobre 1708, votre bon ami, Louis »[2] Le duc leur accorde de plus une pension de 200 florins.";FAUX

The monastery covers an area of 1,800 square meters.[citation needed]

Ownership is a subject of dispute between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.[4][5][6]

According to the Coptic Church, Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan granted the church to the Copts, to be named as ""Deir el-Malak"" (Angel Monastery), which was later confirmed by Saladin, after it was confiscated by the Crusaders, to be renamed as ""Deir es-Sultan"".[7] Later on, the Ethiopian monks were hosted by the Copts in 1654, as their churches in Jerusalem were acquired by the Greek and Armenian Churches due to the inability to pay taxes.[7]

The Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II granted the Ethiopians the right to set up a large tent on the roof of the Holy Sepulcher to celebrate Easter.[8]

During the Easter Vigil in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on April 25, 1970, the Israeli government sent military forces to change the locks of the monastery to enable the Ethiopian monks to take control of it. Afterwards, the Israeli Supreme Court unanimously approved the restoration of the monastery to the Copts on March 16, 1971, yet the government refused to implement the Supreme Court ruling.[7]

In October 2018, a Coptic priest was arrested following protests against the restoration efforts of the monastery without the Coptic Church's consent.[9] In April 2021, ""light clashes"" erupted between Egyptian and Ethiopian monks, as the latter set a tent and raised the Ethiopian flag inside the monastery.[10] The same incident was repeated a year later on 18 April 2022.[11] In 2022, the same type of event provoked the Coptic monks to paint the flag of Egypt on the main door leading to the monastery, adjacent to the entrance to the Coptic Patriarchate of Jerusalem.[12]";

But it is named after its most famous monk, St George of Koziba, who came as a teenager from Cyprus to follow the ascetic life in the Holy Land in the 6th century, after both his parents died.

Another tradition links a large cave above the monastery with St Joachim, father of the Virgin Mary. He is said to have stopped to lament the barrenness of his wife, St Anne — until an angel arrived to tell him she would conceive.

Anna, Arabic: كنيسة القديسة حنة, Hebrew: כנסיית סנטה אנה) is a French Roman Catholic church and part of the French national domain in the Holy Land[1] located in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, near the start of the Via Dolorosa, next to the Lions' Gate. The site is also known as al-Madrasa as-Salahiyya (Saladin's madrasa).

History of the site
During the Roman period a pagan shrine for the cult of the god of healing (a syncretic mix between the Egyptian god Serapis and the Greek god Asclepius), stood on the grounds next to the two Pools of Bethesda.[2]

A Byzantine basilica was built over the remains of the shrine in the 5th century. Partially destroyed by the Persians in 614, it was subsequently restored.[3] Baldwin I, the first titled Crusader king of Jerusalem, banished his wife Arda to the old Benedictine convent which still existed here in 1104.[2] A small Crusader church, the so-called Moustier, was then erected over the wall separating the northern and southern Pools of Bethesda, among the ruins of the Byzantine church.

The current Church of St Anne was built sometime between 1131 and 1138, during the reign of Queen Melisende. It was erected near the remains of the Byzantine basilica, over the site of a grotto believed by the Crusaders to be the childhood home of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus. It is dedicated to Anne and Joachim, the parents of Saint Mary, who according to tradition lived here.[4]


Stone inscription in Arabic located at the entrance of the Salahiyya Madrasa.

1862, Philipp Wolff.
Unlike many other Crusader churches, St. Anne's was not destroyed after the 1187 conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin (Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn). In 1192, Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn converted the building into a madrasa (Islamic educational institution),[3] known as al-Madrasa as-Salahiyya (of Saladin),[5][6] as is still written in the Arabic inscription above the entrance. In the 15th century it was considered as the most prestigious college in the city, counting among its more prominent students the Islamic jurist and city historian, Mujir al-Din (1456–1522).

During Muslim Ottoman rule in Palestine, Christian pilgrims were only permitted inside the grotto after paying a fee. Eventually the madrasa was abandoned and the former church building fell into disrepair. In 1856, in gratitude for French support during the Crimean War, the Ottoman sultan Abdülmecid I presented it to Napoleon III.[7]

In 1862, the French government dispatched the architect Christophe-Edouard Mauss to Jerusalem for this purpose.[8] In 1873, while working on the renovations, Mauss discovered the vestiges of the Bethesda Pool next to the church.[8]

Since 1878, it has been administered by the Missionaries of Africa, a Catholic order, commonly called the ""White Fathers"" for the colour of their robes.[3] Between 1882 and 1946 the site has housed a seminary for the training of Greek-Catholic priests.


Central apse with main altar
Design and construction
Built between 1131 and 1138 to replace a previous Byzantine church, and shortly thereafter enlarged by several meters, the church is an excellent example of Romanesque architecture.[2] The three-aisled basilica incorporates cross-vaulted ceilings and pillars, clear clean lines and a somewhat unadorned interior. The nave is separated from the lower lateral aisles by arcades of arches. The high altar, designed by the French sculptor Philippe Kaeppelin incorporates many different scenes. On the front of the altar are depicted the Nativity (left), the Descent from the Cross (center) and the Annunciation (right); on the left-hand end is the teaching of Mary by her mother, on the right-hand end her presentation in the Temple.[9] In the south aisle is a flight of steps leading down to the crypt, in a grotto believed by the Crusaders to be Mary's birthplace. An altar dedicated to Mary is located there. The Byzantine basilica was partly stretched over two water basins, collectively known as the Pools of Bethesda, and built upon a series of piers, one of which still stands today in its entirety.

In 1862, the French architect Christophe-Edouard Mauss was dispatched by his government to Jerusalem with the special assignment of restoring the time-damaged church";

Main article: Abbey of Saint Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat
By 1130, during the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, the church was rebuilt by the Benedictines,[8] who installed a walled monastery,[dubious – discuss] the Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehoshaphat; the church is sometimes mentioned as the Shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat (or Joshaphat). The monastic complex included three towers for protection, and was decorated with early Gothic columns and red-on-green frescoes.[citation needed]

The Crusader building from 1130 included an upper church built on the ruins of its predecessor, demolished in 1009 by Caliph al-Hakim, and a lower church, consisting of the crypt of the Byzantine church, and as additions built by the Crusaders, a southern entrance followed by a staircase.[8] Abbey of Saint Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat was a Benedictine abbey situated east of the Old City of Jerusalem, founded by Godfrey of Bouillon on the believed site of the Tomb of the Virgin Mary.[1]

History
The abbey was built near a Byzantine church containing the shrine of Mary's Assumption. The first monks of the abbey were from Godfrey's entourage. They managed the Church of Saint Mary, the Grotto of the Agony, and the Church of Gethsemane, all located near the Mount of Olives.[2]

Arnulf of Chocques renovated the church in 1112. Queen Morphia was buried there, starting a precedent whereby queens of Jerusalem were buried apart from their husbands, who were entombed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1120, King Baldwin II installed his cousin Gilduin of Le Puiset, son of Hugh I of Le Puiset, as abbot. Queen Melisende was also buried there.[3]

Early travelers described the church and grotto in their travelogues. These include Descriptio terrae sanctae (Description of the Holy Land) by German priest John of Würzburg (fl. 1160s) and Libellus de Locis Sanctis attributed to the unknown monk Theoderich (12th century).[";

The grotto holds a prominent religious significance to Christians of various denominations as the birthplace of Jesus. The grotto is the oldest site continuously used as a place of worship in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the Holy Land.[3]

The church was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great a short time after his mother Helena's visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus.[4][5] That original basilica was likely built between 330 and 333, being already mentioned in 333, and was dedicated on 31 May 339.[4][5] It was probably destroyed by fire during the Samaritan revolts of the sixth century, possibly in 529, and a new basilica was built a number of years later by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), who added a porch or narthex, and replaced the octagonal sanctuary with a cruciform transept complete with three apses, but largely preserved the original character of the building, with an atrium and a basilica consisting of a nave with four side aisles.[4][5]

The Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinianic reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved).[6] Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one Catholic, one Armenian Apostolic, and one Greek Orthodox,[7] of which the first two contain bell towers built during the modern era.[6]

The silver star marking the spot where Christ was born, inscribed in Latin, was stolen in October 1847 by Greek monks who wished to remove this Catholic item.[4] Some assert that this was a contributing factor in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire.[8] Others assert that the war grew out of the wider European situation.[9]

Since 2012, the Church of the Nativity is a World Heritage Site and was the first to be listed by UNESCO under 'Palestine'.[10][11]

Since 1852, the rights of the three religious communities are ruled by Status Quo.[12][1]

Base in scripture
Of the four canonical gospels, Matthew and Luke mention the birth of Jesus, both placing it in Bethlehem.[13][14] Luke mentions the manger: ""and she gave birth to her son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.""[15]

A variant of the narrative is contained in the Gospel of James, an apocryphal infancy gospel.[16]

History
Holy site before Constantine (ca. 4 BC–AD 326)
The holy site known as the Nativity Grotto is thought to be the manger where Jesus was born. In 135, Emperor Hadrian had the site above the grotto converted into a worship place for Adonis, the mortal lover of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and desire.[17][18] Jerome claimed in 420 that the grotto had been consecrated to the worship of Adonis, and that a sacred grove was planted there in order to completely wipe out the memory of Jesus from the world.[17][19]

Around AD 248, Greek philosopher Origen of Alexandria wrote the following about the grotto:

In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshiped and reverenced by the Christians.[20]

Constantinian basilica (326 – 529 or 556)
The first basilica on this site was built by Emperor Constantine I, on the site identified by his mother, Empress Helena[21] and Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem.[22] The construction started in 326[21] under the supervision of Makarios, who followed Constantine's orders,[23] and was dedicated on 31 May 339[24]—however, it had already been visited in 333 by the Bordeaux Pilgrim,[25][26] at which time it was already in use.[25]

Construction of this early church was carried out as part of a larger project following the First Council of Nicaea during Constantine's reign, aimed to build churches on the sites assumed at the time to have witnessed the crucial events in the life of Jesus.[21][27] The design of the basilica centered around three major architectural sections: [28]

At the eastern end, an apse in a polygonal shape (broken pentagon, rather than the once proposed, but improbable full octagon), encircling a raised platform with an opening in its floor of ca. 4 metres diameter that allowed direct view of the Nativity site underneath. An ambulatory with side rooms surrounded the apse.[28]
A five-aisled basilica in continuation of the eastern apse, one bay shorter than the still standing Justinianic reconstruction.[28]
A porticoed atrium.[28]
The structure was burned and destroyed in one of the Samaritan Revolts of 529 or 556, in the second of which Jews seem to have joined the Samaritans.[29][7][30]

Justinian's basilica (6th century)
The basilica was rebuilt in its present form in the 6th century on the initiative of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565), after the destruction of either 529 or 556.[4] It was probably accomplished after the Emperor's death, as is indicated by the dating of the wooden elements embedded in the church walls between 545 and 665, which was provided by the dendrochronological analyses made during the recent restoration works.[31]

The Persians under Khosrau II invaded Palestine and conquered nearby Jerusalem in 614, but they did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander Shahrbaraz was moved by the depiction above the church entrance of the Three Magi wearing the garb of Persian Zoroastrian priests, so he ordered that the building be spared.[32][33]

Crusader period (1099-1187)

The basilica and grounds as they were depicted in a work published in 1487
The Church of the Nativity was used as the primary coronation church for Crusader kings, from the second ruler of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1100 and until 1131.[34] In an earlier phase starting from c. 1130, the Crusaders promoted the redecoration of the building in the medium of wall painting: images of saints were displayed in the central and southern colonnades of the nave, largely on the initiative of private donors, as is shown by the frequent use of dedicatory inscriptions and portraits. Remnants of a cycle of narrative scenes are preserved in the north-western pillar of the choir and the south transepts, as well as in the chapel located below the bell tower.[35] The Crusaders undertook extensive decoration and restoration on the basilica and grounds,[34] a process that continued until 1169,[7] from 1165 to 1169 even through a sort of ""joint venture"" between the Latin Bishop of Bethlehem, Raoul, the Latin King Amalric I of Jerusalem and the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos.[36] As detailed in the bilingual Greek and Latin inscription in the altar space, the mosaic decoration was made by a teamwork headed by a painter named Ephraim. Another bilingual, Latin and Syriac, inscription located in the lower half of a mosaic panel displaying an angel in the northern wall of the nave bears witness to the work of a painter named Basil, who was probably a local Syrian Melkite. The two artists collaborated within the same workshop.[37]

Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (1187-1516)

The wooden Armenian door in the narthex of the Nativity Church, 1227
The Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem and its area in 1187 was without consequences for the Nativity church. The Greek-Melkite clergy was granted the right to serve in the church, and similar concessions were given almost immediately also to other Christian denominations.

In the year 1227 the church was embellished with an elegantly carved wooden door, the remnants of which can still be seen in the narthex. As detailed in its double, Armenian and Arabic inscription, it was made by two Armenian monks, Father Abraham and Father Arakel, in the times of King Hethum I of Cilicia (1224-1269) and the Emir of Damascus, and Saladin's nephew, al-Mu'azzam Isa.[38] In 1229 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II signed an agreement with Sultan al-Kamil which led to the restitution of the Holy Places to the Crusaders. The property of the Nativity Church came back into the possession of the Latin clergy on the condition that Muslim pilgrims may be allowed to visit the holy cave.[39] Latin hegemony probably lasted until the incursion of Khwarezmian Turks in April 1244. On that occasion, the church treasures, now preserved in the Terra Sancta Museum in Jerusalem, were concealed underground and rediscovered only in 1863. The church was devastated, but not destroyed, the major damage being the dilapidation of its roof.[40][41]

Under Mamluk rule, the church was used by different Christian denominations, including Greeks, Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians, and Syrians. In 1347 the Franciscans of the newly established Custody of the Holy Land were bestowed with the ownership of the former monastery of the regular canons to the north of the basilica. The Friars managed to gain a hegemonic role in Bethlehem until the Ottoman period.[42]

Starting from the late 13th century, pilgrims lament the dilapidation of the church interior by order of Mamluk authorities: in particular, the marble revetments of the walls and floor were gradually removed, until they thoroughly disappeared.[43]

The Duchy of Burgundy committed resources to restore the roof in August 1448,[41] and multiple regions contributed supplies to have the church roof repaired in 1480: England supplied the lead, the Second Kingdom of Burgundy supplied the wood, and the Republic of Venice provided the labor.[32]

Ottoman period, first three centuries (16th–18th)

The Grotto of the Nativity, painted by Luigi Mayer, late 18th century
After the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Nativity church suffered from a long decay. The nave was largely abandoned and used for profane purposes. In the aim to prevent people from entering the church with horses and cattle, the main entrance was walled up and transformed into a diminutive door, known until our days as the ""Door of Humility"", since visitors are forced to bend down to go through it.[44] An elevated chancel, provided with three doors, thoroughly separated the nave from the east end of the building, which was reserved for liturgical activities. The Ottoman period was characterized by increasing tensions between the different Christian denominations. In 1637, Greeks were granted hegemony by the Sublime Porte and the Franciscans were expelled from the holy cave. In 1621 the Armenian Patriarch Grigor Paronter bought the partly ruined buildings to the south of the courtyard and established there a monastery and a hospice for pilgrims. In 1639, the Cretan painter Jeremias Palladas was commissioned by the Greek Patriarch to paint new icons to embellish the church. Further works were made in 1671 on the initiative of Patriarch Dositheos II. In 1675, Dositheos managed to gain control also of the nave, and promoted restorations of the floor and the roof, as well as the making of a new iconostasis. The Franciscans were restored in their rights in 1690, but they lose their hegemony once again in 1757, when the Greek Orthodox were granted full ownership of the upper church and the authorization to keep the keys to the grotto. Afterwards, a redecoration of the church was promoted: the nave was newly paved, the bema was provided with a solemn iconostasis and a wooden baldachin was erected over the main altar.[45]

Because of uninterrupted water infiltrations from the roof, the Crusader mosaics started falling down, as is documented in many pilgrims' accounts from the 16th century onwards.[46]";

The Benedictine monastery in Abu Ghosh, officially St Mary of the Resurrection Abbey,[1] (French: Abbaye Sainte-Marie de la Résurrection d'Abu Gosh) is a monastery run by the Olivetan Benedictine order in Abu Ghosh, Israel.

Its church is built on the foundations of the Crusader-period Church of the Resurrection, or Church of our Lord's Resurrection.[2] It was established in the 12th century on top of Roman ruins in the center of Abu Ghosh, known by the Crusaders as Fontenoid. Until the 19th century, the Arabs called the village Qaryet al-'Inab. The site was associated by the Crusaders with Emmaus from the Gospel of Luke.

France claims ownership of the land as the French national domain in the Holy Land, under the Ottoman capitulations and says this was formalised by the Fischer-Chauvel Agreement of 1948, which has not been ratified by Israel. The late Romanesque/early Gothic-style church[3] was built by the Hospitallers in 1140.[4] It was acquired by the French government in 1899 and placed under the guardianship of the French Benedictine Fathers. Edward Robinson (1838) described it as ""obviously from the time of the crusades, and [...] more perfectly preserved than any other ancient church in Palestine."" Excavations carried out in 1944 confirm that the Crusaders identified the site as the biblical Emmaus. The church is built over an ancient spring.

From 1956, the monastery was run by the Lazarist Fathers.

Today a double monastery of nuns and priests worship in the church and offer hospitality, commemorating the New Testament story of the couple on the Jerusalem–Emmaus road.[4]

The walls are bearing traces of the Crusader-period frescoes, painted in Byzantine style and restored between 1995 and 2001";

Remains of the Crusader church in Bayt Jibrin, 2009
In 1099, Crusaders invaded Palestine and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1135, King Fulk of Jerusalem erected a castle on the lands of Bayt Jibrin, the first of a series of Crusader fortifications built at this time to ensure control over the ports of Caesarea and Jaffa.[22][10] In 1136, King Fulk donated the castle to the Knights Hospitallers. In 1168, the Hospitallers were granted a charter to establish a Frankish colony, which they named ""Bethgibelin"".[55] Christian settlers in Beit Jibrin were promised a share of property looted from the Muslims.[56] It was on the itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, who found three Jews living there when he visited the country.[57] The Ayyubid army under Saladin sacked Bethgibelin in 1187, after most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem came under Muslim control as a consequence of his victory at the Battle of Hittin. Soon after its capture Saladin ordered the demolition of the Crusader castle. From 1191 to 1192, the town was held in probate by Henry of Champagne, as lord of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, while Saladin and Richard the Lionheart negotiated a ceasefire.[58]

However, the Crusaders remained in control of Bethgibelin until 1244, when the Ayyubids reconquered it under Sultan as-Salih Ayyub. By 1283, the Mamluks had taken control and it was listed as a domain of Sultan Qalawun.[59] The city prospered under the Egypt-based Mamluk Sultanate and served as a postal station.[10] During Mamluk rule, Bayt Jibrin administratively belonged to Hebron and was under the jurisdiction of the Shafi'i (a school of law in Sunni Islam) qadi (head judge) of that city.[59]

From the first years of the establishment of the Crusaders in the city, the Hospitallers received donated properties. In 1110, King Baldwin granted the Knights Hospitaller permission to keep the constructions located north of the Sainte-Croix church. In the years 1130, the buildings were damaged during works near the church and the Hospitallers decided to move near the 12th century north wall of the city. This is the actual place of the commandery.

In 1149, the first testimony of the commandery is in a document concerning the construction of the Saint-Jean church. In 1169, a pilgrim described the commandery of the Hospitallers of Acre as a very impressive fortified building.

Relocation of headquarters
After the defeat of Hattin in 1187, Saladin took the city. In 1191, during the third Crusade, the Frankish reconquered Acre after its siege. The Hospitallers moved back in their buildings. Jerusalem is no longer in the hands of the crusaders. And so the commandery becomes the new headquarters of the order. A new construction campaign took place between the end of 12th century and 13th century with new wings and additional floors.";

Château Pèlerin is located inside the Atlit naval base.

The Knights Templar began building the fortress in 1218 during the Fifth Crusade. One of the major Crusader fortresses, it could support up to 4,000 troops in siege conditions. It became for a short time the headquarters of the Crusaders; according to Claude Reignier Conder its architecture ""must have made ‘Athlit perhaps the finest town of the period in the country"".[2] It has been described as the ""crowning example of Crusader military architecture"",[3] although T. E. Lawrence found it lacking in elegance and imagination in terms of military architecture, settling on massiveness instead. In early August 1291, three months after the Siege of Acre, the forces of Al-Ashraf Khalil conquered Atlit, which was at that point the last remaining Crusader outpost in Syria, thus permanently ending Crusader presence in the region.[4]

The fortress remained intact for several hundred years, until suffering damage in the Galilee earthquake of 1837. In the 14th century, it became home to a large concentration of Oirat Mongols. During early Ottoman rule, in the 16th century, it was recorded in tax registers as a port of call and a farm. Later, in the 19th century, it was a small fishing village under the influence of the local al-Madi family";

It is first mentioned in 1210 as a Knights Templar fortress. It was dismantled in 1279 by Hugh III of Cyprus. It passed into the possession of the Knights Hospitaller in 1308, falling into obscurity afterwards.

History
The castle was situated on the northern side of Famagusta Bay, 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) to the south-west of Gastria village. In 1191, Cyprus was taken by Richard the Lionheart during his campaign against the island's ruler Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Richard subsequently sold the island to the Knights Templar, whose rule abruptly ended after a major revolt in Nicosia. Cyprus was then resold to Guy of Lusignan of the House of Lusignan. Gastria Castle is first mentioned in 1210, when the royal regent Walter of Montbéliard sought refuge in the fortress with his allies the Templars.[1] He had previously refused to render an account of his administration of the royal treasury to the newly crowned Hugh I of Cyprus, subsequently fleeing to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. A period of peace ended with the death of Hugh in 1218.[2][3]

A struggle over who should act as the kingdom's regent ensued, pitting the House of Ibelin with the local supporters of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick's arrival in Limassol in 1228 escalated the conflict into an open war. In 1229, John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut returned to Cyprus through Gastria's port. In 1232, after a defeat at the Battle of Agridi, Frederick's few remaining supporters requested permission to hide in Gastria. Having fought Frederick at Acre in 1229 the Templars refused and those who attempted to hide in the ditch were apprehended. Afterwards, the Lusignans continued their reign interrupted only by occasional palace coups.[4][5] In 1279, Hugh III of Cyprus dismantled the castle and expelled the Templars, after the latter declared their support for Charles I of Naples. In 1308, the castle was granted to the Knights Hospitaller. In 1310, Henry II of Jerusalem passed through Gastria while en route to his exile to Armenia. It was no longer mentioned as a castle from that point on";

The site is considered sacred by the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[7][13]
The oldest record of monastic life at Mount Sinai comes from the travel journal written in Latin by a pilgrim Christian woman named Egeria (Etheria; Saint Sylvia of Aquitaine) about 381/2–386.[14][15]

The monastery was built by order of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush (also known as ""Saint Helen's Chapel"") ordered to be built by Empress Consort Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the burning bush.[5] The living bush on the grounds is purportedly the one seen by Moses.[6] Structurally the monastery's king post truss is the oldest known surviving roof truss in the world.[16]
Centuries after its foundation, the body of Saint Catherine of Alexandria was said to be found in a cave in the area. The relics of Saint Catherine, kept to this day inside the monastery, have made it a favourite site of pilgrimage.[12] The patronal feast of the monastery is the Feast of the Transfiguration.";

Egeria mentions a woman named Marthana who hosted female visitors to Hagia Thecla and directed some cells of hermits. The ""Life and Miracles of Thecla"" describes the original shrine/ church (before its relocation in the second half of the fifth century) as including living quarters for a community of virgins (10.5-6).

The castle is in the rural area of Silifke district of Mersin Province at 36°15′24″N 33°46′14″E. It is on a plateau at the southern slopes of Toros Mountains overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The altitude is 380 metres (1,250 ft) and the birds' flight distance to sea shore is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) which makes the castle an excellent observation point. The distance to main highway (D 400 ) is 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), to Silifke is 33 kilometres (21 mi) and to Mersin is 116 kilometres (72 mi).

History
The castle was built by Byzantine Empire in the 12th century. Later on, it was captured by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. In 1210, it was incorporated into the realm of Knights Hospitaller.[1] It was later on captured by the Karamanids and finally by the Ottoman Empire in the late 15th century.";

Geography
The castle is in Silifke district of Mersin Province. It is situated to the west of Silifke city center, to the south of Göksu River (Calydanus of the antiquity) and to the north of the Turkish state highway D.715. Although its altitude is only 160 metres (520 ft) with respect to sea level, it is dominant over Silifke plains and the southern section of Göksu valley.[1]

History
Silifke (Roman: Seleucia; Byzantine: kastron Seleukeias; Arab: Salûqiya; Armenian: Selefkia or Selewkia; Frankish: Le Selef) was an important city in antiquity. Founded by and named after Seleucus I Nicator (359 BC-281 BC), one of the Diadochi who served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great. Few traces of the 3rd-century-B.C. settlement survive. There are fragments of a late Roman theater, necropolis, bath, 2nd-century temple, as well as a 5th-century Byzantines cistern. The 1st-century-A.D. stone bridge built during the reign of Emperor Vespasian was replaced in the 1870s. In the late 7th century, to counter Arab invasions, the Byzantines fortified the acropolis, which is situated above the Calycadnus River. The site had a weapons factory and was the administrative center for the coastal theme.[2] In the late-1180s the Rubenid Baron Leo II, who became a decade later Leo I, King of Armenian Cilicia, captured the town and fortress. In exchange for money and cavalry support King Leo granted the castle in 1210 to the Knights Hospitaller who were to defend the western border of his kingdom from the Seljuk Turks. According to a survey published in 1987, most of the present castle is a Crusader construction.[2] On the death of King Leo in 1219 his daughter and designated heiress Zapēl, (also known as Isabella, Queen of Armenian Cilicia), was contracted to marry Philip, the son of Bohemond IV of Antioch. After various disputes with the Armenian barons Philip died by poison in 1226. Zapēl and her mother took refuge in Silifke. When the Armenian army arrived, the Franks surrendered the castle. A fragmentary Armenian inscription in the castle may record its repair or enlargement in 1236.[3] In 1248 the castle may have briefly had a Frankish commander, named Guiscard.";

Limassol was the main seat of the Order between the fall of Acre in 1291 and the move to Rhodes in 1310. Kolossi Castle is a former Crusader stronghold on the south-west edge of Kolossi village 14 kilometres (9 mi) west of the city of Limassol on the island of Cyprus.[1] It held great strategic importance in the Middle Ages, and contained large facilities for the production of sugar from the local sugarcane, one of Cyprus's main exports in the period. The original castle was possibly built in 1210 by the Frankish military, when the land of Kolossi was given by King Hugh I to the Knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Hospitallers).[2]

The present castle was built in 1454 by the Hospitallers under the Commander of Kolossi, Louis de Magnac, whose coat-of-arms can be seen carved into the castle's walls.[3]

Owing to rivalry among the factions in the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, the castle was taken by the Knights Templar in 1306, but returned to the Hospitallers in 1313 following the abolition of the Templars.[4]

The castle today consists of a single three-storey square keep, 21m high and with dimensions 17x17m. It has an attached rectangular enclosure or bailey about 30 by 40 metres (98 by 131 ft).[5]

As well as for its sugar, the area is also known for its sweet wine, Commandaria. At the wedding banquet after King Richard the Lionheart's marriage to Berengaria of Navarre at nearby Limassol, he allegedly declared it to be the ""wine of kings and the king of wines."" It has been produced in the region for millennia, and is thought to be the oldest continually-produced and named wine in the world, known for centuries as ""Commandaria"" after the Templars' Grand Commandery there.";

Aswan, a city steeped in ancient tales and breathtaking landscapes, is not only home to the iconic Elephantine Island and the Tombs of the Nobles but also cradles the enigmatic remnants of this monastery.
A journey to this archaeological wonder is a journey through time itself, offering a glimpse into the spiritual and cultural legacy that has endured for centuries. In this exploration of Aswan's historical gems and the nearby marvels of Elephantine Island and the Tombs of the Nobles, we delve into the mystical allure and enduring charm of the Saint Simeon Monastery Ruins, discovering the secrets they hold and the stories they tell.
The history of the Saint Simeon Monastery in Aswan (Anba Hatre)
The history of the Saint Simeon Monastery, also known as Anba Hatre, is a testament to the enduring spiritual and architectural legacy of ancient Egypt. Nestled on the western bank of the Nile River, near Aswan, this remarkable monastery offers a glimpse into the past, telling a story that spans centuries of devotion, transformation, and the passage of time.

Originating in the 6th century, during the height of Egypt's Christian monastic movement, the Saint Simeon Monastery was dedicated to Anba Hatre, a local saint known for his ascetic lifestyle and profound spirituality. The monastery's strategic location along major trade routes facilitated its growth, and it soon flourished as a center of Christian worship, learning, and communal living.

The original structures of the monastery were constructed from mudbrick and wood, showcasing the architectural techniques of the time. Over the years, however, the monastery underwent several renovations and expansions, with stone replacing mudbrick and sturdy walls rising to accommodate the needs of a growing monastic community. Its distinctive layout included chapels, living quarters, dining areas, and even cells carved into the rock for solitary contemplation.

The monastery's heyday coincided with the zenith of Christianity in Egypt. Pilgrims and monks from near and far sought solace within its walls, while it played a crucial role in shaping the theological discourse of the era. The Monastery's impressive rise was, unfortunately, followed by a gradual decline. Factors such as changes in political power, shifts in religious affiliations, and economic challenges eventually led to its abandonment.

Today, the Saint Simeon Monastery stands as an awe-inspiring ruin, a testament to its former glory and the passage of time. Its towering walls and intricately carved architecture offer a glimpse into the artistic and engineering prowess of its creators. The isolated location of the monastery also contributed to its preservation, as it protected the site from the destructive forces of modern development.

Visitors who journey to the Saint Simeon Monastery are rewarded with an experience that transcends time. The monastery's haunting beauty, set against the backdrop of the Nile and the desert, creates an atmosphere of contemplation and reflection. The echoes of centuries of worship and spiritual pursuit can still be felt within its crumbling walls.

As one explores the Saint Simeon Monastery, the layers of history come alive. From its humble beginnings as a retreat for devoted hermits to its transformation into a bustling center of faith and learning, the monastery's story is a microcosm of Egypt's rich and diverse history. The Saint Simeon Monastery stands as a silent witness to the ebb and flow of civilizations, a testament to the enduring power of human devotion and the architectural marvels of ancient times.";

It is likely that the history of the monastery dates to the fourth century AD.  The monastery had many monks since its establishment until the 12th century AD when it was destroyed in the year 1173. The old church in the monastery was built in the Medieval Ages, according to the documentary of the ordination of Rev. Isaiah Al-Naqadi.  Rev. Isaiah was ordained a priest for Archangel church in Zaher Naqada by His Holiness Pope Yoannis the 13th, the 94th Patriarch on Friday the 11th of Toba of the year 1224 of the martyrs (January 7, 1508, AD). 

As an evidence that this monastery had a blooming monastic life at earlier times is the fact that about 250 meters away, in the cemeteries adjacent to the monastery there is an antique monastic cell with one dome that is built of the same mud bricks used in building the monastery. Also, five hundred meters north of the monastery in the mountain, there is a small cave surrounded by a lot of pottery, as a footprint of monastic life in this monastery in the sacred wilderness of El-Assas. 

The diocese was joyful upon the recognition of the Monastic life in that monastery during the seminary of the Holy Synod in the month of November 2014 AD during the reign of His Holiness Pope Tawadros who visited the monastery on January 15, 2016. ";

Here's what I can tell you about it:

Location: It is located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, east of the city of Qena, situated in the mountainous terrain often associated with the Red Sea mountains. It's relatively isolated, typical of ancient desert monasteries.

History and Origins: It is considered one of the ancient Coptic monasteries in Egypt, with traditions tracing its origins back potentially as far as the 4th century AD, the very beginnings of Christian monasticism in the desert. Like many desert monasteries, it likely began as a collection of hermit cells before developing into a more structured monastic community over time. It is dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle.

Significance:

Ancient Heritage: It's part of the rich and long tradition of Coptic desert monasticism, which played a foundational role in the development of Christian monasticism worldwide.
Spiritual Center: For centuries, it has served as a place of spiritual retreat, worship, and asceticism for monks and pilgrims.
Resilience: It represents the enduring presence and resilience of Coptic Christianity in Egypt, having survived through various historical periods.
Current Status: St. Andrew's Monastery is an active monastery today, inhabited by Coptic Orthodox monks who continue the ancient monastic traditions. It functions as a living community of faith and prayer.

Features: While not as widely visited or documented as some larger monasteries, it typically includes ancient churches (often with older architectural elements or built into natural features like caves), monks' living quarters (cells), a refectory, and protective walls common to desert monasteries.

In essence, St. Andrew's Monastery near Qena is a significant historical and spiritual site, representing a deep connection to the roots of Egyptian monasticism and the enduring faith of the Coptic Orthodox Church.";

The vision promised to establish a monastery in the name of the great martyr, and it was fulfilled 20 years later as the land was purchased in El-Khatatba in 1994 during the papacy of thrice-blessed Pope Shenouda III. The area was architecturally planned and cultivated, and divided into fields as construction began in 1996 for churches, a retreat house, and cells, and completed in 2006. Pope Shenouda III welcomed the establishment of the monastery in the name of a great martyr, the prince, St. Victor (Mari Boctor), son of Romanos, when the developments were presented to him in 2010, and he gave Hegumen Fr.

It’s very glorious, very amazing, very awe-inspiring. Intercede for us sinners, oh holy St Pisentius.

On this day (20th July) Anba Pisentius, Bishop of Qift, departed. This saint was born in the village of Shamir, district of Armant, about the year 284 of the martyrs (568 A.D.) to pious Christian parents who raised him up with evangelical principles. He learned the church subjects since his young age and memorized many of the holy books. He longed for the monastic life so he went and became a monk in the monastery of Abi FAM on mount Shamah. He was discipled at the hands of the saint Anba Elijah the great and spent most of his monastic life on el-Asas mount.

This saint pursued his monastic struggle diligently caring for perpetual prayers, memorizing the Holy Bible along with many fasts. He ate once every two days or every three days and at times once a week. When he prayed his fingers lit like candles and when he read in the prophetic books the prophet who wrote the book would appear to him.
 
Once one of the brethren came to his cell and found the door was opened and as he entered he found him talking to another person. The brother took the hand of the guest and kissed it as the guest was leaving. The brother asked Anba Pisentius saying; “I ask you O my father let me know the name of this saint for when I held his hand and kissed it, I felt a great power came upon me and my heart was filled with joy and peace.” Anba Pisentius replied: “The Lord looked upon my weakness and illness so He sent me one of His chosen saints, Elijah the Tishbite, who comforted me with his heavenly words.”
 
The Lord performed many miracles by his hands. Once all the water pots were empty while he was up on the mountain and the brethren was about to die of thirst, the saint prayed and they found the pots full of water so they glorified God. When he entered the inner wilderness he had difficulty finding water, he prayed for four days and the Lord sprung fresh water well for him.
 
Pope Demian (Demianos), 35th Patriarch, consecrated him a bishop for Qift about the year 595 A.D. He accepted the ordination according to a divine calling and he told the priests of the parish: “If not for the fear of being disobedient to the One commanded me, I would not have agreed to you in this matter even if you had beheaded me.” He was a watchful shepherd cared for the salvation of every soul and was charitable. He was known for his awe-inspiring appearance for no one could look at his face in spite of his smile and the ease of talking with him. Whenever he went up to the altar to pray his face would shine as fire and the sins of the people would be revealed before him. He beheld the Holy Spirit coming down upon the holy gifts. God granted him the gift of prophesying and the door of his cell was opened to everyone.
 
When his departure drew near, he called his disciple John and told him, and then he gathered the people and exhorted them. Finally he asked them not to bury him in splendid garments but with the apparel that he had on. He fell sick for a short while then departed in peace.

The most famous and historically significant Coptic Orthodox Monastery dedicated to St. Moses the Black (Deir Anba Moussa al-Aswad) is actually located in the Wadi El Natrun area of the Western Desert, between Cairo and Alexandria. This is one of the four major ancient monasteries still active in Wadi El Natrun and is a very important spiritual center.

While there might be churches or smaller monastic dependencies dedicated to St. Moses the Black in Upper Egypt, including areas near Luxor, there isn't a widely recognized, large, historical monastery explicitly named ""St. Moses the Black Monastery"" that is located in or immediately around Luxor in the same way that the prominent one is in Wadi El Natrun.

It's possible you might be thinking of:

The Monastery in Wadi El Natrun: This is the primary site associated with the name ""St. Moses the Black Monastery.""
Another site dedicated to him elsewhere: There could be smaller churches or monastic houses bearing his name in various locations.

St. Pachomius is well known for many things but he is most known for being the founder of cenobitic monasticism in Egypt. Pachomius was born to pagan parents in Thebaid (Upper Egypt). There he received an excellent secular education.
At the age of either 20 or 21, he was called to serve in the Roman army. He became a high ranked officer in the army and was touched by the love of the Christian people of Esna in Upper Egypt. It was then that he stayed in a prison, used to house the new conscripts, which was run by Christians. So he decided that if he would return safely from the war he will seek to learn more about Christianity. He was so impressed by their love and compassion to others that he vowed to become a Christian after his military service ended.
Thus in 314 Pachomius was baptized and began to practice the ascetic life. Three years later he withdrew to the desert under the guidance of the elder Palamon. According to tradition, after ten years with Palamon he heard a Voice telling him to found a monastic community at Tabbenisi (also Tabenna, Tabbenisiot). He and Palamon traveled there, and subsequently Pachomius had a vision in which an angel came to him, clothed in a schema (a type of monastic garment), and gave him a rule for the cenobitic life.";

It was uninhabited for a period of time, but in 1975, Coptic Orthodox monks reestablished a presence there. Excavations done by French archeologists between the Monastery of Saint Matthew the Poor and the Monastery of the Martyrs have revealed much about the history of Coptic monasticism in this region.

Art and Architecture
The 11th century monastery church bears much architecturally in common with the Christian architecture of Nubia. It is sunk into the ground and constructed with no ground-level windows. There are windows in the dome to let in light and provide passive ventilation. There is a large central dome supported by squinches. Surrounding this are smaller ambulatory arches and side chapels.[1]

Artistically, the monastery is noted for the preserved frescoes in its main basilica. These are likely from the 11th-13th centuries and show Jesus and the Apostles, as well as local saints and Nubian kings. The frescoes have been covered by centuries of grime, but are well preserved.[1]";

It commemorates St. Ammonius and the martyrs who were killed during the Diocletianic Persecution.
Event Commemorated: Traditionally c. 303 AD. The monastery complex developed around the site of their martyrdom over time. The establishment of a formal monastery could be slightly later, but the site's significance dates to the persecution. The Monastery of Saint Ammonius, also known as the Monastery of the Martyrs, is a Coptic Orthodox monastery near Esna. In the first centuries A.D., Esna had a significant Christian population. A monk named Ammonius was ordained their bishop in the early years of fourth century as Diocletian's persecution was raging. Perhaps in the year 307 A.D., Ammonius took his congregation to the monastery of St. Isaac the Hermit, located in the mountains West of Esna, to celebrate the saint's feast day. Diocletian's appointed governor for the area, Arianus, followed with his troops and killed the congregation, said to number 160,000 people. Ammonius was arrested and tortured but would not recant his faith. Instead, he prophesized that Arianus himself would embrace Christianity and be martyred. With that, Ammonius was put to death. Remains of ""innumerable bodies"" found in a mass grave about three kilometres West of Esna, at a location that corresponds with the monastery of St. Isaac, provided tangible proof of the persecution.";

It is traditionally thought that the monastery was founded by the hermit Saint Ivan of Rila, whose name it bears, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (r. 927–968). The hermit actually lived in a cave without any material possessions not far from the monastery's location, while the complex was built by his students, who came to the mountains to receive their education.

Ever since its creation, Rila Monastery has been supported and respected by the Bulgarian rulers. Large donations were made by almost every tsar of the Second Bulgarian Empire until the Ottoman Conquest, making the monastery a cultural and spiritual centre of Bulgarian national consciousness that reached its apogee from the 12th to the 14th centuries.

Rila Monastery was re-erected at its present place by Hrelja, a feudal lord, during the first half of the 14th century. The oldest buildings in the complex date from this period — the Tower of Hrelja (1334–1335) and a small church just next to it (1343). The bishop's throne and the richly engraved gates of the monastery also belong to the time. However, the arrival of the Ottomans at the end of the 14th century was followed by numerous raids and a destruction of the monastery in the middle of the 15th century.

Thanks to donations by the Sultana Mara Branković, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Rossikon monastery of Mount Athos, Rila Monastery was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century by three brothers from the region of Dupnica. With Sultana Mara Branković's influence, Ivan of Rila's relics were moved from Tarnovo into the new complex in 1469.

The complex acted as a depository of Bulgarian language and culture in the ages of foreign rule. During the time of the Bulgarian National Revival (18th and 19th centuries), it was destroyed by fire in 1833 and then reconstructed between 1834 and 1862 with the help of wealthy Bulgarians from the whole country, under the architect Alexi Rilets. The erection of the residential buildings began in 1816, while a belfry was added to the Tower of Hrelyu in 1844. Neofit Rilski founded a school in the monastery during the period. The monastery is known as being one of the hideouts of Bulgarian revolutionaries such as Vassil Levski, Gotse Delchev, and Peyo Yavorov.

The monastery complex, regarded as one of the foremost masterpieces of Bulgarian National Revival architecture, was declared a national historical monument in 1976 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Since 1991 it has been entirely subordinate to the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

On 25 May 2002, Pope John Paul II visited Rila Monastery during his pilgrimage to Bulgaria. He was greeted by the monastery's igumen, Bishop Ioan, who had been an observer at the Second Vatican Council.";

It is believed that the Kremikovtsi Monastery was built during the reign of the king Ivan Alexander (1333-1371), but there is certain evidence for its existence from the 15th century. When the Ottoman troops conquered Sofia city in 1382, the monastery was completely destroyed. The first record for the Kremokovtsi Monastery dated back to 1493. During that time the local lord Radivoy restored the ruined church “St.George” and renovated its wall-paintings in the memory of his two children who died during the time of the massive black death outbreak in 1492 . The roof of the temple was destroyed during an earthquake in 1503 and a new one was built, but with another donator’s inscription from 1611, announcing the complete renovation of the church.

During the Ottoman Slavery the Kremikovtsi Monastery was an important literary and cultural centre for Sofia’s residents and many liturgical books have been transcribed there. After the martyr’s death of St. Georgi Sofiiski (i.e. George of Sofia), some of his relics have been transferred in the monastery.

Like most of Bulgarian monasteries, the Kremikovtsi Monastery was s shelter for revolutionaries from the period of Ottoman rule.

About 20 nuns from Malashevsko settled in the Kremikovtsi Monastery after the Liberation of Bulgaria and contributed to the exhilaration and the popularity of the monastery. The famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov had visited the monastery in 1897 and then wrote an extraordinary itinerary for it. The construction of the new big church “The Shroud of the Holy Mother” began in 1901 and it was completely finished in 1907. Meantime, next to the western wall of the kitchen, a residential building for the nuns has been built. The rest of residential buildings dated back to the 30tis of 20th century.

Until the 50ties of 20th century the Kremikovtsi Monastery was a convent as during that time 32 nuns were living in the monastery. After that soldiers settled in the monastery and they have been accommodated in the monastery for 18 years. A part of the buildings was conflagrated and many of the murals were painted out.

Nowadays the Kremikovtsi Monastery was awakened for new life and the restoration of the frescoes in the small church has begun in 1980 and with several halts they have continued until 2003. A new monastery kitchen with flowing water and a big fireplace have been built on the place of the old burnt cook-house. A fountain was constructed in the monastery in 1994 and wooden tables and benches were installed in its courtyard. A massive wooden door was constructed and the walls in the old building and in the main big building were painted. The two churches are maintained in a good condition and in the summer the whole courtyard is green because of the colourful flowers and the lush verdures.";

It is one of the few medieval Bulgarian monasteries well preserved until today.

The earliest archaeological evidence of medieval life at the place is a grave with a few coins and decorations from the time of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (1259–1282). Some other items also date to the 13th century while the marble frieze above the central gate of the church dates to the 13th or 14th century. A couple of new buildings were constructed in the monastery at the time of Despot Alexius Slav. The earliest written source testifying to the monastery's existence is a note on a chant book from 1551, today in the Great Lavra library on Mount Athos.

The monastery church was built before the 15th century and painted in 1597; some of those frescoes are preserved. In 1611, the south facade was painted. The Rozhen Monastery was devastated by fire between 1662 and 1674, destroying the library and severely damaging most buildings. The monastery was restored over the next century with the financial help of rich Bulgarians from the whole country. The reconstruction began in 1715 and was fully finished in 1732.

The monastery reached its apogee in the 19th century, when it was a regional centre of Orthodox Christianity and owned a lot of land in the area. Famous Bulgarian revolutionary Yane Sandanski's grave is located near the monastery.";

So it is with the Coptic monastery of Saint Damiana in the northern Nile Delta, not very far to the south of Damietta. The shrine here is dedicated to a woman known as Damiana (Dimyana, Damyana, Damyanah, Demiana) who, according to tradition, was the daughter of Marcus, a Christian governor who lived in the middle of the third century AD. Her story is different, though in some ways, very reminiscent of St. Catherine, who is perhaps better known because of her association with the more famous Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai. Nevertheless, it is Saint Damiana who is frequently referred to as the founder of female monastic life.
Actually, these days this is a convent, rather than a monastery. The Shrine of Saint Damiana, or Dair Sitt Dimyana, once belonged to the diocese of the metropolitan of Jerusalem, but was served from very ancient times by the monks from the Monastery of Saint Antony.
When Damiana flowered into womanhood, her father chose a nobleman for her to marry. However, Damiana refused, for she had ben taught the Christian virtue of virginity. ""If you really care for me, built me a castle where I can live and preserve my virginity and serve my Christ,"" she told her father. Being a beloved child, the father complied, building her a large palace that covered an area of fifteen feddans. Soon afterwards, the daughters of other noblemen followed her example, so together with forty other virgins, she took up residence in the palace to serve their lord. According to tradition, it was Saint Helena, the mother of Constantine, who later built Damiana and her forty virgins a tomb, and around that tomb a monastery was eventually erected. The first church of that complex is said to have been erected on the orders of John I (496-505), the twenty-ninth patriarch of Alexandria. That church, however, was destroyed when ocean floods covered the whole land. Even the tomb of Saint Damiana and her forty virgins remained under water for seventy years. Finally, the local Christians began to pray, asking God to withdraw the waters from their holy shrine, and the waters afterwards receded. Then, John II camped near the original location of the tomb, he had a dream in which Saint Damiana appeared to him and ordered him to build a church. He complied with her wishes, building her a church which today is located in the southwest part of the complex. There is no doubt that it is in the most ancient part of the monastery.";

Discovery of the martyrs and construction of the monastery:

In the year 400 AD, on the evening of the first day of the month of Blessing, Saint Dioscorus and the martyrs had a vision of the faithful man Peter, the man they had left to guard their cell. They said to him, “Do not be sad, because Allah, who knows the secrets of hearts, has left you and did not want you to present yourself as a martyr, but gave you this wilderness so that you may have children in it.” Many people and you will be the father of many monks very soon. Now get up and take out the stone so that we can determine for you the place that you will build on the bodies of your martyred sisters and it will become full of monks. Then they took him out in the vision at night to a large hill and determined that place for it in its length and breadth and asked it to be for the people of the city to collect the bodies of the martyrs. And when they finished talking, they disappeared from him, and Peter, the man of Allah, woke up from his sleep and immediately realized in himself that the saints had summoned him to carry their bodies. So he got up early and went to the camp and found their bodies lying on top of each other. They all went up to the hill that the saints knew. Peter in the vision found the marks placed there as they had specified them, so they cleaned those. The spot and they dug cemeteries there for the bodies of the martyrs Dioscorus, Escalapius, and the twenty-two monks, and buried them in a separate place. Then they went to the church of Abu Sotir and found the bodies of the martyrs lying one on top of the other. They shrouded them and buried them under the wall of the church of Abu Sotir al-Qibli.

Dedication of the Church of the Martyrs:

After burying the martyrs, a pledge of allegiance was held in the name of the martyrs

Martyrs of Al-Khamim:

Akhmim was one of the countries where Christianity spread, and most of its residents were Al-Nasarah. This is what made this region rich in monasteries, as there are currently eight monasteries in it. Emperor Diocletian issued orders in the year 284 AD to persecute Al-Nasarah. In the year 304 AD, the governor Arianus was more cruel than Diocletian and continued to torture Al-Nasarah.

Monastery Church:

It has five structures

Temple of the Archangel Michael

Temple of Saints Dioscorus and Escalapius

Temple of the Virgin Maryam

Margis structure

The temple of Saint Mark and Bishop Anthony

The temples are based on the old system, which Queen Helena built according to the system of the Monastery of the Martyrs in Basna. They have two entrance gates and a window to monitor those entering the church from enemies. The temple’s veil is topped with an archaeological image, and the other structures are like the usual structures.

The church consists of two choirs, not three as is usual in churches

The first choir contains the relics of Saint Dioscorus and Escalapius, and the head of a martyr that still remains as it is placed inside a glass compartment where her face and hair can be seen.

The nave of the church consists of two choirs with a large opening in the middle and is covered with domes

Around the monastery there are ancient cemeteries from which, much earlier, the famous Coptic textiles were excavated. They fill a number of museums around the world.

Monastery features:

There is a mud brick wall on all four sides. The monastery is now witnessing great development. A wall was built for it over a large area, and inside it is a farm.

A special shrine was also created in the monastery for the rest of the martyrs

Currently 8,140 martyrs are buried in the monastery

Spanning approximately two feddans, the monastery contains five churches, including the Church of Saint Pishoy, the largest church in Wadi El Natrun. Additional features include a guesthouse, expansive gardens, a library, an ancient refectory, and the Well of the Martyrs, as well as apartments where monks reside.[7] Pope Shenouda III often visited the monastery for seclusion, sometimes as a form of symbolic protest against various issues.[8]

History
The Monastery of Saint Pishoy, initially established as a monastic community under Saint Pishoy in the late 4th century AD, is one of the oldest monastic settlements in Wadi El Natrun. Founded contemporaneously with Saint Macarius the Great, the monastery originally comprised a cluster of monks' apartments and a central church built around Saint Pishoy's cave, with no defensive walls.[9]

In 407 AD, the church was destroyed in a raid by Libyan Bedouins, marking the first of several such incursions. Subsequent attacks in 434 and 444 AD caused further destruction,[10] and a fourth Berber raid in the late 6th century severely damaged the church and the fortified tower. Restoration efforts were led by Pope Benjamin I in 645 AD, which included rebuilding both structures.[11]

Another raid occurred in 817 AD, prompting further repairs by Pope Jacob I, while Pope Joseph I returned the relics of Saints Pishoy and Paul of Tammah to the site and oversaw the construction of the main church,[12] which dates back to 840 AD.[13] In 1069 AD, the Berber Luata tribe invaded the monastery, leading to additional reconstruction under Pope Benjamin II in 1319 AD, who was later interred in the main church. The monastery was noted by the historian Al-Maqrizi in the 15th century for its extensive grounds, despite being in a state of disrepair.[14]

During the papacy of Pope Shenouda III, the Monastery of Saint Pishoy underwent renovations. He initiated the restoration of the monks' apartments and repaired the water well where the Berbers had washed their swords after the massacre of the Forty-Nine Martyrs of Scetis. Additionally, Pope Shenouda allocated approximately 300 acres of surrounding desert for land reclamation, established a private papal retreat, and facilitated the introduction of electricity to the monastery.[15]

Notably, the holy oil of chrism (myron) was prepared at the monastery five times during his tenure, specifically in 1981, 1987, 1990, 1995, and 2008. This myron was distributed to Coptic churches both within Egypt and abroad, highlighting the monastery's role in the broader Coptic Orthodox community during his leadership.[16]";

It is thought to have been built in the 4th century. by an Egyptian saint called Pishay, a contemporary of Pigol, founder of the White Monastery.

Almost nothing is known about the history of the Red Monastery near Sohag, though it is one of Egypt's most famous Christian monasteries. It lies about two miles (3.2 km) north of the White Monastery at the extreme western edge of the cultivated land. However, unlike the White Monastery, it is situated in a small village, and some houses lie to the south and east. The area to the north and west of the monastery is mainly covered with debris.

Its name is derived from the colour of its construction material, consisting of red (burnt) brick, of its outside walls, distinguishing it from its nearby neighbor, the White Monastery, which is made of stone. These walls are considerably thicker at the base than at the top, and like ancient Pharaonic temples, as well as the White Monastery, are surmounted by cavetto moldings. Otherwise, this monastery is architecturally similar to the White Monastery, and most likely, its construction dates to the same period, probably the 5th century.

The monastery was dedicated to Pshoi. He was a contemporary of Apa Pigol, the founder of the White Monastery. In his Life of Shenute, Besa says, ""The holy apa [Pgol] and the young man Shenoute went out walking together, and with them also went Apa Psoi (from Mt. Psoou). He too was a holy man who walked after godly things"" (Besa 9, p. 44). Hence, one may identify ""Psoou"" (Psou) with the Red Monastery.

While the 15th-century Arab historian al-Maqrizi names the monastery, he provides none of its history. The probable reason is that it was closely related to the White Monastery. Vivant Denon visited the monastery during French invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798–99, but states that the facility had been ransacked and burned down by the Mamluks of Ottoman Egypt only a few days before his arrival.[2] Currently, the monastery is occupied by only a few monks. The church still serves the Coptic communities of the surrounding villages and pilgrims who come here during the big feasts of the liturgical year.

Atripe;Coptic Orthodox ;;Saint Shenoute;400;2025;1625;Ottoman rule;Egypt;EGY;Sohag;26,56055556;31,69166667;Female;;;;personal research NY;;"The site of Atripe has long been the reputed location for the late ancient women’s monastery associated with the monastic federation headed by Shenoute of Atripe. 
Atripe, also known as Athribis,[1] is located at the village of Sheikh Hamad some 5 km to the south west of the modern city of Sohag. Its most prominent surviving feature is the Ptolemaic temple (fig. 1) dedicated to the goddess Repit. The temple of the goddess’s consort, Min, was located on the east bank of the Nile in the city of Akhmim (ancient Panopolis), the capital of the nome (i.e. province). Through the process of adaptive reuse, the temple later became a focus for Christian activities, but whether these were the remains of the women’s monastery in Shenoute’s federation, centered at the nearby White Monastery, has long been uncertain.[2]

The work of the Yale Monastic Archaeology Project (YMAP-South) at the site of Atripe has been motivated, at least in part, by a few important guiding questions. Do the remains there in fact belong to a monastery? If so, when was it active and what can the traces reveal about its history, organization, and gendered identity? The results of YMAP-South’s work have begun to provide answers to these questions. The site has now been verified as a late antique monastic foundation inhabited by female monastics and associated with Shenoute’s name and memory. Atripe (Nubian, Saint Shenoute)

Atripe is the site of the famous White Monastery (Deir el-Abyad) in Egypt, founded by Saint Pigol, but made famous by his nephew and successor, Saint Shenoute the Archimandrite.
Saint Shenoute was abbot from around 385 AD until his death in 466 AD. The monastery flourished under him.
Founding Period: While St. Pigol founded it earlier, its significant development and fame are from the late 4th and early 5th century AD under St. Shenoute. Atripe (Greek Athribis; Coptic ⲁⲑⲣⲓⲡⲉ / ⲁⲧⲣⲓⲡⲏ) lies on the west bank of the Nile opposite modern Sohag in Upper Egypt, c. 500 km south of Cairo.  
In late antiquity it became famous not for a Nubian, but for a native-Egyptian (Coptic) monastic centre: the so-called White Monastery of Saint Shenoute.  Because Nubia was evangelised from Upper Egypt, Nubian monks did eventually study or stay there, but Atripe itself belongs to the heartland of Coptic, not Nubian, Christianity.

Why the “Early Nubian” label is misleading  
• “Nubian Christian” normally refers to the medieval kingdoms of Nobadia, Makuria and Alwa (6th–15th c.) located south of Aswân in present-day Sudan.  
• Atripe/White Monastery flourished two centuries earlier (late 4th–6th c.) and 230 km north of the First Cataract inside Egypt proper.  
• Nubian pilgrims and students are sporadically attested at Atripe from the 7th c. onward, but the site’s foundation, language (Coptic Sahidic) and liturgy are Egyptian.

Below is a concise dossier on the place as an EARLY COPTIC MONASTERY.

1. Foundation and history
────────────────────────────────────────
• ca AD 335 Small laura established by the anchorite P̱gol (Pcol) at Atripe.  
• ca 385-465 Golden age under Abbot Shenoute “the Archimandrite”; community grows to perhaps 2,000 monks and nuns organised in three houses (men, women, novices) plus dependent farms.  
• ca 440-450 Great basilica (“White Monastery church”) erected from finely dressed limestone recycled from pharaonic temples—hence the modern name Deir el-Abyad.  
• 6th–8th c. Continues as a leading intellectual centre; Shenoute’s discourses copied, Arabic begins to replace Greek on ostraka after Arab conquest (AD 642).  
• 9th–12th c. Intermittent decline; repeated Bedouin raids, but repairs under Abbots Joseph II and Moses of Abydos.  
• 1798 Described by the French savants of the Description de l’Égypte.  
• 1883-89 Library fragments bought by dealers begin to reach museums in Berlin, London, Paris; these become the core of the “Shenoutean corpus.”  
• 1907–20 & 1980s–today Archaeological clearance by Lefort, Evelyn-White, and the German Athribis project; ongoing digital documentation by the White Monastery Manuscript Project (Universities of Hamburg & Yale).

• Landed domain stretched 30–40 km along both Nile banks; papyri record vineyards, flax fields, and quarries worked by lay tenant farmers who paid rent to the monastery.  
• Monks operated granaries, olive-oil presses and a pottery kiln; amphorae stamped with a cross-in-circle monogram are typical finds on the Sohag market.  
• Shenoute’s letters show the monastery acting as a local “police force,” protecting peasants against tax collectors and nomads, arbitrating disputes, sheltering fugitives.  
• Pilgrimage hostel housed Syriac, Nubian and Ethiopian visitors; Nubian names begin to appear in guest lists only after ca AD 650.

Founded in the mid-14th century by Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander, the monastery was abandoned after the Ottoman conquest of Sofia and reestablished in the late 15th century, when it became an important literary centre. The monastery church and some of its frescoes date from this period.

History
Located 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) south of the capital Sofia's neighbourhood of Dragalevtsi, Dragalevtsi Monastery was established by Tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) in 1345 at the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire.[1] The monastery was first mentioned in the Vitosha Charter issued before 1382 by Tsar Ivan Shishman (r. 1371–1395).[2] The charter granted lands and tax exemptions to Dragalevtsi Monastery,[3] including ownership of the village of Novachene.[4]

After Sofia fell to the Ottomans in 1382, the monastery was disbanded and its buildings destroyed. It was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th century with the financial support of local feudal lord Radoslav Mavar and rapidly developed into a repository of Bulgarian cultural records.[1] In 1612, while staying at Dragalevtsi Monastery, the monk Job Kasinets from Timișoara wrote the Boyana Beadroll, a list of medieval Bulgarian rulers. The document shows the extent to which medieval rulers were remembered in 17th-century Bulgarian lands.[5] Other manuscripts completed in this period at the monastery's scriptorium include Priest Nicholas' Gospel of 1469, the Dragalevtsi Gospel of 1534 and a psalter finished in 1598.[6]

Today only the monastery church survives from what was a significantly more extensive complex of buildings in the 15th century. The church was expanded in 1818[7] and 1932.[1] In the late 19th century, Dragalevtsi Monastery was often visited by national hero Vasil Levski, who used it as a centre for his revolutionary activities.[8] The monastery is currently inhabited by nuns.[1]

The monastery church, eponymously known as the Church of the Holy Mother of God, measures 12 by 5 metres (39 ft × 16 ft). It has a single apse and a single nave. Architecturally, it shares many features with other contemporary churches in the Sofia region, including the Church of St Petka of the Saddlers in the city and the church of the Kremikovtsi Monastery.[6]

Mural portraits of Radoslav Mavar and his immediate family as church donors (ktetors) were painted on the inside of the monastery church. In addition to these, other 15th-century frescoes also survive, alongside 16th- and 17th-century paintings.[1] The frescoes of warrior saints Demetrius of Thessaloniki, George and Mercurius on the upper reaches of the west facade date to 1475–1476. The saints are clad in realistically painted full knight's armour of the period, with Demetrius and Mercurius wearing spurs. One of the murals depicts Demetrius battling Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan (r. 1197–1207), who is shown as an enemy of the faith.[9] The iconostasis of the church was carved and installed in the 18th century. The icons in the church are the work of 19th-century Samokov Art School painter Nikola Obrazopisov.[7]";

It is situated close to the Razboishte village, Sofia Province, at about 10 km (6 mi) to the west of the town of Godech. The monastery is situated in the gorge of the Nishava river, at the distance of about 5 km. southwest of the town of Godech, next to the village of Razboishte. The first information about the Monastery dates to the 4 th century. In this time the place, where nowadays is situated the rock church, was used as a covert by an unknown Orthodox ruler. The caves were also a shelter to St. Sava. There is a legend which tells that, when he set out for Jerusalem, the period of the Lent catch him here and he had to spent here 40 days. As a result of his stay here, the place became holy and from then till nowadays there is a holy spring which water comes from the rock.
During the Ottoman rule the Apostle of the freedom Vasil Levski and Matei Preobrajenski not just once came there.
In the time of the Serbian-Bulgarian war here were fought a lot of battles. The Monastery “The Assumption” was burned down several times. Almost all of the documents about it were swept away and there fore all the historical information about the monastery that we know is a legend.

The village can be reached by car through the roads from the towns of Dragoman or Godech, but the monastery buildings are accessible by car only by a dirt road, when the land is dry, from Kalotina and Cheparlintsi village. Most visitors prefer to walk about a kilometer from the village of Razboishte.

History
The oldest piece of information about Razboishte Monastery dates as far back as the 4th century A.D. The rock caves around were populated by monks-hermits during the Middle Ages. The caves were also used as a shelter by St. Sava. According to legend, the Long Lent find the Saint here in the course of his journey to Jerusalem so he stayed for 40 days.

During the 18th century the monastery itself came into existence. A small single-nave church was built outside the walls into the nearby rocks just above the Nishava river. The cook-house was added in 1861.

It is known that the buildings were set on fire three times by Ottoman conquerors. The Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski stayed at the monastery several times.

Nowadays
In the beginning of 20th century Razboishte Monastery became desolated until 1947 when three nuns settled here. They found the buildings in decay and the priceless frescoes in the old church almost completely destroyed. In the course of time the nuns, with the help from the local people, succeeded in restoring the Monastery and reconstructing the church. The new chancel-screen is from 1950, but the remnants from the old one are kept in the monastery. There are some old frescoes preserved on the west facade of the initial church.

It lies in the Chiprovtsi part of the western Balkan Mountains, 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) southwest the village of Georgi Damyanovo, Montana Province.

Founded in the Middle Ages but built in its present appearance throughout the 1850s, the Lopushna Monastery, and particularly its complex main church, are one of the most notable works of the Slavine Architectural School and its most prominent figure, Lilo Lazarov. It was in the construction of the monastery cathedral that Lazarov first employed vernacular Gothic decorative features, a trademark approach of the Slavine School that set it apart from other architectural schools of the Bulgarian National Revival.

Geography and history
The Lopushna Monastery is situated in the valley of the Dalgodelska Ogosta river, in the vicinity of the village of Georgi Damyanovo, formerly known as Lopushna.[1] It lies at around 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level and can be reached through the Petrohan Pass from the capital Sofia, which is 105 kilometres (65 mi) to the south.[2][3]

The original monastery was probably established during the Second Bulgarian Empire (12th–14th centuries). The monastery had to endure torching and plundering raids in the 14th–18th centuries, the period of the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. In the following decades, the support of the nearby Chiprovtsi Monastery meant that the Lopushna Monastery consolidated financially. In the 1840s, Archimandrite Dionysius and the hieromonks Gerasimus and Gideon of the Chiprovtsi Monastery joined the Lopushna Monastery, Dionysius as its hegumen (abbot). Having collected funds, the clerics sought to reconstruct the ill-maintained monastery buildings.[1]

During the Bulgarian National Revival (18th–19th centuries), the Lopushna Monastery housed a religious school and was a haven for Bulgarian freedom fighters and supporters of the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate. National writer Ivan Vazov spent some time at the monastery and wrote part of his most famous work, the novel Under the Yoke (1888), there. The monastery was reconstructed in 1989 due to structure-threatening damage to the north residential wing.[3]

Architecture
Construction and style
The present facilities of the monastery, a monument of culture of national importance,[4][5] were mostly constructed in 1850–1853 by Lilo (Ilia) Lazarov, a Bulgarian architect from Slavine. The current yard gate, stone fence and north and south residential wing were all built in 1850–1853. Some finishing touches were being applied to the church up until 1856, when the pavilion drinking fountain was built as well, and the ossuary was added in 1860.[1]


Frontal view of the external narthex and an elaborately decorated door
The monastery cathedral, the Church of Saint John the Baptist,[2] is regarded as the finest and most complex example of church architecture of the Slavine Architectural School established by Lazarov. The architectural approach of the Slavine School, one of 44 such informal schools of the Bulgarian National Revival, is unique with its implementation of Gothic decorative features. Projects by the Slavine School prominently include geometric decorations based on the triangle on apses, domes and external narthexes, as well as sharp-pointed window and door arches. Another discerning feature of the school is the exterior stone relief decoration, in which rosette ornaments play an important part.[6]

Inspiration for the church was the cathedral of the Rila Monastery, the most important monastery in the Bulgarian lands. Lazarov twice visited the Rila Monastery to observe the church's architecture. Before commencing the construction of the Lopushna Monastery church, he made a hazel model of his project in order to receive the approval of the monks and the hegumen. Only two other churches in Bulgaria bear a resemblance to that design: the main church of the Rila Monastery and that of the Etropole Monastery. However, while the Lopushna Monastery church takes inspiration from the Rila Monastery for its plan, it is radically different in decoration and appearance from that of the Rila Monastery. Instead of following the Byzantine Revival and partially Baroque Revival style of the Rila Monastery, the Lopushna Monastery church's architecture displays Gothic Revival features, which were entirely innovative for Bulgarian vernacular architecture at the time. The decoration of windows, cornices, plinths and particularly doors, as well as until 1923 of the porch, is dominated by sharp-pointed shapes and broken lines.[7]";

Conception Convent in Novgorod Veliky (often known as the Desyatinny Monastery of the Conception of St. Anne - Десятинный монастырь в честь Зачатия праведной Анны) during medieval times.

Here's what was notable about that convent in the medieval period:

Location: It is located in Novgorod Veliky, within the city limits, specifically in the area historically known as the ""Desyatina"" (hence the name Desyatinny Monastery). This places it within the heart of medieval Novgorod's vibrant urban life.

Foundation (Medieval):

The Novgorod Conception Convent was founded earlier than the Moscow one. Its founding date is typically cited as 1348.
It was founded under the auspices of the powerful Archbishop Moisei of Novgorod, a major figure in the independent Novgorod Republic. This connection to the archbishopric gave the monastery significant standing and probably access to resources.
Purpose and Role:

Like its Moscow namesake, it was founded as a convent for women (a female monastery).
It was one of the notable monasteries within the city of Novgorod itself, part of the dense network of churches and monasteries that characterized medieval Novgorod. These urban monasteries were not just spiritual centers but were often integrated into the civic life of the republic.
It provided a place for women to enter monastic life, dedicate themselves to prayer and asceticism, and participate in the spiritual rhythms of the city.
Dedication: It is dedicated to the Conception of Saint Anne by the Most Holy Theotokos (the Conception of the Virgin Mary by her mother, St. Anne).

Medieval Characteristics:

The original medieval buildings would have been primarily wooden, as was common in Novgorod during that period (stone was used, but many structures remained wood). This made it vulnerable to Novgorod's frequent fires.
It would have housed a community of nuns led by an Abbess, following the rules of Orthodox monasticism.
Novgorod monasteries often played a role in chronicle writing, manuscript copying, and social welfare, and it's possible the Conception Convent participated in some of these activities, although it might not have been as prominent in chronicle writing as some of the male monasteries.
In summary, the Conception Convent in Novgorod, founded in 1348 under Archbishop Moisei, was a significant medieval female monastery within the city of Novgorod Veliky. It served as an important spiritual institution for women, was closely linked to the powerful Novgorod Archbishopric, and was a part of the unique urban monastic landscape of the medieval Novgorod Republic, distinct from the developing monastic tradition of Muscovy.";
Nikolo-Perervinsky Monastery;Russian Orthodox ;0;Saint Nicholas;1623;1928;305;Soviet closures;Russia;RUS;Veliky Novgorod;58,52099;31,27579;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Nikolo-Perervinsky Monastery (Николо-Перервинский монастырь in Russian) is the southernmost historical monastery of Moscow. It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Miracle-Worker. It is situated at south of the district of Pechatniki between the Moscow river and the Lublino railroad classification yard.

The abbey was first mentioned in the city records in 1623, although it is believed that it had existed for more than a century prior to that. Its name (from the Russian verb ""to interrupt"") is explained by the fact that the Moskva River has repeatedly changed its flow at this place. The abbey began to expand in the mid-17th century and grew especially large at the turn of the century, when Patriarch Adrian made the cloister his summer residence and built the so-called Old Katholikon (1696–1700). In 1775, they opened a theological seminary on the premises of the monastery. Its main sources of income were Sukharev Tower, Iverskaya Chapel and other sketes, attached to it by the ecclesiastic authorities.

In 1908, the vast New Katholikon was consecrated to the Holy Icon Our Lady of Iberia. The abbey was closed down in 1928. The Russian Orthodox Church resumed divine service in the Old Katholikon in 1991. Nikolo-Perervinsky Monastery (Николо-Перервинский монастырь) in Moscow during medieval times, focusing on its activities during that period.

Compared to some other Moscow monasteries, Nikolo-Perervinsky is a relatively later medieval foundation, which shapes its early history.

Location: It is located south-east of the historical center of Moscow, near a bend in the Moskva River (the name ""Perervinsky"" comes from ""pererva,"" meaning a break or gap in the river, possibly referring to an oxbow lake or flooded area).

Foundation (Late Medieval):

The monastery was founded in the late 15th century, traditionally cited around 1495.
Its founder is believed to be Grand Prince Ivan III (Ivan the Great), the ruler who significantly expanded and consolidated the Muscovite state. This royal patronage was a key factor in its establishment.
It was dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Role and Activities in Medieval Times (Late 15th - Early 16th Century):

Monastic Life: As a monastery, its primary activity was the monastic life – housing a community of monks dedicated to prayer, worship (following the cycles of Orthodox services), fasting, and ascetic discipline.
Royal Foundation & Patronage: Being founded by Ivan III meant it received support and attention from the Grand Prince's court. Royal or princely monasteries often received land grants or other resources, which would have been crucial for its initial establishment and survival.
Strategic Location: Its location south-east of the city center, by the river, gave it some strategic significance. Monasteries on the approaches to Moscow often served defensive purposes, acting as potential watchpoints or fortified locations, particularly relevant during periods when Moscow was consolidating its power and facing threats from the south.
Economic Activities: Like most medieval monasteries, Nikolo-Perervinsky would have engaged in economic activities necessary for self-sufficiency. This would have included:
Agriculture: Cultivating land granted to the monastery.
Fishing: Utilizing its location on the Moskva River.
Crafts: Monks might engage in various crafts like icon painting, manuscript copying (though it's not primarily known as a major scriptorium for this early period), carpentry, etc.
Managing Estates: If granted lands, managing the peasant labor on those estates.
Spiritual Service to the Area: While not centrally located, it served as a spiritual center for the people living in its vicinity.
Distinction from Later Activities: It's important to note that Nikolo-Perervinsky became very prominent in later centuries (17th-19th) as a major center of theological education and printing (housing the Perervinsky Seminary and a large print shop). However, these activities are characteristic of its post-medieval history and were not its primary functions during its initial medieval period (late 15th - early 16th century).

In summary, during medieval times (specifically the late 15th and very early 16th centuries), Nikolo-Perervinsky Monastery was a relatively new foundation, established under the patronage of Grand Prince Ivan III. Its activities centered around standard monastic life, utilizing its royal connections and strategic location, and engaging in the economic practices necessary for survival, rather than being a major intellectual or printing hub as it would become much later.";

Novodevichy Convent (Новодевичий монастырь) in Moscow during medieval times.

It's important to note that Novodevichy Convent is a relatively late medieval / early modern foundation. It was founded in 1524 by Grand Prince Vasily III, the father of Ivan the Terrible. So, its ""medieval"" history is primarily its very early history right at the cusp of the medieval and early modern periods of Russian history.

Here's what was notable about its activities during this initial period:

Foundation as a Royal Convent: Its primary purpose was to be a major female monastery directly connected to the Grand Princely (and soon, Tsarist) court. Vasily III founded it to commemorate the capture of Smolensk from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1514.

It was intended to be a place of spiritual devotion for women, but also served as a prestigious convent where women from the royal family and highest nobility might take the veil, sometimes voluntarily, sometimes under political pressure (this became more pronounced in later centuries but was part of its potential role from the start).
Monastic Life: Like all monasteries, its central activity was the monastic life for the nuns. This included:

Daily cycles of Orthodox worship, prayer, and church services in its main cathedral (initially the Cathedral of the Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God, built in the 1520s).
Following strict rules of fasting, asceticism, and communal living.
Engagement in spiritual reading and contemplation.
Strategic and Defensive Role (Fortress-Monastery): This was a key function from its inception. Vasily III had the monastery built as a powerful fortress.

Its location, on a bend of the Moskva River south-west of the Kremlin, was strategically significant for defending the approaches to Moscow.
Its impressive brick walls and towers, constructed shortly after the foundation, were designed for military defense. This meant the monastery and its inhabitants were involved in the defense of the capital city during periods of threat (e.g., Tatar raids). While the nuns weren't soldiers, the monastery complex itself was a military asset maintained and supported by the state.
Economic Management: As a major royal foundation, Novodevichy was endowed with considerable land and other resources.

A significant activity was managing these estates, collecting revenues from the peasants living on monastery lands, and ensuring the economic self-sufficiency of the large community of nuns.
They would have been involved in overseeing agriculture, possibly fishing (given its river location), and other necessary economic activities.
Cultural Activities (Early Period):

Church Building and Decoration: The construction and decoration of the main cathedral (with frescoes) and other early churches were major activities.
Textile Arts: Convents were often centers for exquisite needlework and embroidery, particularly for creating church vestments, icons, and hangings. This would have been a key activity for the nuns.
Manuscript Copying: While not as renowned as a scriptorium as some older male monasteries, copying religious texts was a standard monastic practice.
In summary, during its early medieval/early modern period (late 15th/early 16th century onwards), Novodevichy Convent in Moscow was established as a major royal female monastery. Its activities centered on traditional monastic life for women, leveraging its royal connections and significant resources, serving a crucial strategic defensive purpose as a fortress, and engaging in the economic and cultural activities necessary for a large, prestigious monastic community. Its immediate role as a fortress was a particularly defining characteristic from its very beginning.";

Today the monastery is a large complex surrounded by high walls with several churches, a bakery and a lush garden. The 120 monks who live here have dedicated their lives to seeking God in the stillness and isolation of the desert, in a life built completely around prayer.

From its beginnings as a loosely organised grouping of hermits, the monastery evolved over a few centuries to a somewhat more communal existence in which the monks continued to live anchoritic lives, but in cells grouped together inside a walled compound. Despite the changes, the monks still follow traditions and examples set by St Anthony, St Paul and their first followers 16 centuries ago.

The Church of St Anthony is the oldest part of the monastery and the main highlight of a visit here. It's built over the saint’s tomb and contains one of Egypt’s most significant collections of Coptic wall paintings. Painted in secco (whereby paint is applied to dry plaster), most date back to the early 13th century, with a few possibly much older. Stripped of centuries-old dirt and grime, the paintings are clear and bright, and demonstrate how medieval Coptic art was connected to the arts of the wider Byzantine and Islamic eastern Mediterranean.

Most of the monks who guide tours will take you up onto a section of the monastery's fortified walls for a short walk to see the large basket and wooden winch that were the only means of getting into the complex in times of attack. In the 8th and 9th centuries the monastery suffered Bedouin raids, followed in the 11th century by attacks from irate Muslims and, in the 15th century, a revolt by bloodthirsty servants that resulted in the massacre of the monks. From the top of the walls you get a great view of the small mud-brick citadel into which the monks retreated during these attacks. Visitors are not usually allowed to enter.

You also get an excellent panorama over the monks' impressive cultivated gardens. These are fed by a spring sourced deep beneath the desert mountains that produces 100 cu metres of water daily, allowing for the bountiful oasis of shady trees within the monastery grounds.

The monastery is open daily throughout the year except during Advent and Lent, at which time it can only be visited on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. During Holy Week it's closed completely to visitors. For enquiries or to confirm visiting times, contact the monastery headquarters, located off Clot Bey, south of Midan Ramses in Cairo.";

The Monastery of Saint Macarius The Great also known as Dayr Al-ʾanbā Maqār (Arabic: دير الأنبا مقار) is a Coptic Orthodox monastery located in Wadi El Natrun, Beheira Governorate, about 92 km (57 mi) north-west of Cairo, and off the highway between Cairo and Alexandria.[1]

The monastery is attributed to Saint Macarius the Great, a disciple of Saint Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism.[2] Macarius retreated to the Wadi El-Natrun desert and is believed to have established his hermitage there in the last third of the 4th century AD.[3] The monastery was once overseen by Pope Shenouda III,[4] following the resignation of Bishop Michael of Assiut, who had served as its abbot for 65 years. After Pope Shenouda’s death in March 2012, the monks requested the reinstatement of Bishop Michael as abbot.[5] He returned to lead the monastery in April 2012 but resigned permanently shortly after.[6] On March 10, 2013, Anba Epiphanius was appointed abbot, a position he held until his assassination on July 29, 2018.[7][8]

The monastery spans an area of approximately 11.34 square kilometers, including its farmlands and associated buildings.[9][10][11][12] It houses seven churches—three within the main complex and four atop the fortress. Additionally, the monastery includes monk cells (known as kelia), a communal dining hall attached to a kitchen, a small museum, a hospital, an power station, a printing press, and a library containing rare manuscripts. There are also accommodations for non-monk staff working within the monastery.[13]

The monastery is renowned for the purported presence of the relics of John the Baptist and the prophet Elisha within the main Church of Saint Macarius. [14] These relics were reportedly discovered during unofficial restoration and expansion works in 1976, overseen by Father Matta El-Meskeen. The find was officially announced in November 1978, sparking controversy, particularly among Muslims, who believe that prophets' bodies do not decay.[15] Moreover, existing Islamic shrines already attributed to these prophets further complicated the matter. Additional controversy arose following a separate discovery in Bulgaria in 2010, where relics claimed to belong to John the Baptist were unearthed beneath an ancient church.

The monastery also contains relics of other saints and patriarchs, adding to its religious and historical importance.[16]

Etymology
The monastery is attributed to Saint Macarius the Great, also known as Abu Makar or Macarius.[17] He is one of three saints who share this name, the others being Macarius of Alexandria, founder of the Kellia settlement, and Macarius, Bishop of Edkau.[18] Saint Macarius the Great is the founder of this monastery and the pioneer of monasticism in the Wadi El-Natrun region.[19][20]

Born around the year 300 AD (approximately 1,724 years ago), Macarius the Great was the first to establish monastic communities in the Scetis Desert, now known as Wadi El-Natrun. He passed away around 397 AD (approximately 1,627 years ago).[21]

The name Macarius has ancient Egyptian roots, derived from the Demotic term Makhro, meaning ""true of voice,"" signifying honesty and integrity. In Coptic, the name is pronounced Makari, later refined to Makareh with the addition of a final H to reflect a more developed articulation. This evolved into Maqarah or Makar in Arabic, which remains the commonly used form, faithfully reflecting its Coptic origin.[22]

In Greek, the name was adapted with the addition of Waw (letter), becoming Makarios.[23]

History
Ancient history
The exact date of the foundation of the Monastery of Saint Macarius, or even the beginning of the monastic settlement in the area, cannot be determined with precision.[24] However, its emergence as an early monastic community in the Wadi El-Natrun desert can be traced to the latter third of the 4th century AD, specifically following the death of Saints Maximus and Domitius in 384 AD (approximately 1,640 years ago) by Saint Macarius of Egypt, who was the spiritual father to more than 4,000 monks of different nationalities. The monastery has been continuously inhabited by monks since its 4th-century founding. Several Christian saints and fathers of the early Church were monks at the Monastery of Saint Macarius, including Saint Macarius of Alexandria, Saint John the Dwarf, Saint Paphnutius the Ascetic, Saint Isidore, Saint Arsenius, Saint Moses the Black, Saint Poemen, Saint Serapion among others.[1]

The monastic community began with a single cell belonging to Saint Macarius the Great himself.[25] This cell, initially a cave roofed with Djerid and papyrus, was located west of the current monastery near the site of the present Monastery of Baramus. Over time, disciples and followers gathered around him, constructing their own cells at some distance from Macarius's original cell.[26]

As the number of aspiring monks increased, Macarius left the growing community to settle in what is now the site of the Monastery of Saint Macarius, leading to the establishment of the Monastery of Baramus as well.[27]

With the influx of new disciples, a church was built for communal prayers. Adjacent to the church were essential facilities, including a water well, a bakery, and a kitchen for cooking. Over time, the monastery expanded to include storage rooms, a guesthouse, and a refectory for the monks to share the Agape Meal or ""Meal of Love.""[28]

In the 5th century AD, the monastic community of Scetis (Wadi El-Natrun) faced repeated raids by Berber tribes. The first attack occurred in 407 AD

(approximately 1,617 years ago), followed by a second raid in 434 AD (approximately 1,590 years ago). These invasions brought widespread looting, destruction, and loss of life, prompting the monastic communities to construct defensive towers. These towers served as fortifications where monks could seek refuge during attacks. They were equipped with essential supplies, such as food stores, a water well, and a small church for prayer.[29]

The Monastery of Saint Macarius built its first defensive structure, known as the ""Bayamon Fortress,"" shortly before the third Berber raid in 444 AD. The fortress was located near the monastery and was designed to protect both the monks and the monastery's valuable possessions, including manuscripts and other artifacts.[30]

During this raid, 49 elders sought refuge in the Bayamon Fortress but were killed by the Berbers near its walls. Their remains were initially buried in a nearby cave but were later transferred in the 7th century to a church within the monastery dedicated to their memory. This event underscored the need

for fortified structures, shaping the development of monastic architecture in the region.[31]

At the end of the 5th century AD, Emperor Zeno of the Eastern Roman Empire provided financial support for the monasteries of Wadi El-Natrun. This was in honor of his daughter Hilaria, who had secretly fled the imperial palace and later became a nun in the desert region. Zeno’s patronage facilitated renovations and expansions in the monasteries, including the construction of fortified towers, churches, and various monastic buildings with marble columns. He also ordered the reconstruction of the Church of Saint Macarius.

In the early 6th century, Pope Theodosius I consecrated a new church in the monastery dedicated to the Mary, mother of Jesus(Theotokos), marking the first such dedication in Wadi El-Natrun according to Coptic Orthodox tradition. This church, known as the Southern Church, later served as the burial site for the remains of the 49 Elders of Scetis, who had been martyred during earlier Berber raids.

However, by the late 6th century, the monastery suffered extensive damage during the fourth Berber raid around 570 AD (approximately 1,454 years ago). Many monastic settlements were destroyed, leading to a decline in the number of monks. The monastery remained in ruins until it was restored after the Islamic conquest of Egypt in 641 AD.

In 631 AD (approximately 1,393 years ago), during a visit by Pope Benjamin I, a new church was commissioned within the monastery, dedicated to the 49 Elders of Scetis. Later, around 655 AD (approximately 1,369 years ago), Pope Benjamin I consecrated a rebuilt Church of Saint Macarius, known as the ""Benjamin Altar."" This event was witnessed by his disciple Anba Agathon, who later succeeded him as Patriarch.[32]

The Church of Saint Macarius was designed with a sanctuary, a domed choir, a nave, and side aisles.[33]

In 793 AD (approximately 1,231 years ago), during the patriarchate of Pope John IV, the relics of Saint Macarius the Great were transferred to the monastery in a wooden casket. The relics of Saint Macarius of Alexandria were already housed there, and the remains of Saint Macarius of Edku were later added during the time of Pope Michael III.[34]

By the early 9th century, each monastic complex was enclosed by medium-height walls to protect against petty thieves. These walls, however, offered little defense against major attacks. During the fifth Berber raid in 817 AD (approximately 1,207 years ago), the monastery suffered damage once again, highlighting the limitations of these modest fortifications.[35]

During the tenure of Pope Jacob I, construction began on a church dedicated to Saint Shenouda, located south of the Benjamin Altar within the Church of Saint Macarius. Additionally, the Church of Saint Macarius was rebuilt after 825 AD (approximately 1,199 years ago) due to earlier damage. In 847 AD (1,177 years ago), during the patriarchate of Pope Joseph I, another church was constructed in the monastery, named the Church of the Apostles, situated north of the main church.[36]

By the mid-9th century, the monastery housed three churches: the Great Church of Saint Macarius (the Benjamin Altar), the Church of Saint Shenouda to its south, and the Church of the Apostles to its north. Records from 853 AD (1,171 years ago) also mention a fourth church, dedicated to Saint Spheros, which was described as remote and isolated from the other churches.

In 866 AD (1,158 years ago), during the time of Pope Shenouda I, Bedouin tribes raided the monasteries and attacked pilgrims gathered at the Monastery of Saint Macarius. This led to destruction, prompting the Pope to initiate the construction of a fortified stone wall around the main church, the other churches, monastic cells, the tower, the well, and storage facilities. The fort itself was repaired, and new cells were built within the enclosure in 870 AD (1,154 years ago).[37]

Over time, the original front wall of the monastery fell into disrepair and collapsed in the mid-18th century. It was subsequently rebuilt, but the new wall encompassed an area less than half the size of the original. Beyond the walls, the surrounding area was dotted with monastic settlements, or manshoubiyat, that thrived until the 14th century. These settlements were closely associated with the central Church of Saint Macarius and contributed to the monastery’s vitality during this period.[38]

In 884 AD, during the patriarchate of Pope Michael III, Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun visited the Monastery of Saint Macarius. This marked the first visit by a Muslim ruler to the monasteries of Wadi El-Natrun since the Islamic conquest of Egypt.

In 1005 AD (approximately 1,019 years ago), a new church was constructed south of the Benjamin Altar, named the Southern Church of Saint

Macarius. This was necessitated by the previous church being renamed in honor of Saint Benjamin. In 1069 AD (955 years ago), the Berber Luwata tribe raided the monastery and other Wadi El-Natrun monasteries despite their fortified walls. However, unlike previous raids, the Berbers did not inflict damage on the structures.[39]

In 1172 AD (852 years ago), Pope Mark III undertook the restoration of the monastery's outer walls.

In 1264 AD (760 years ago), Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars visited the monastery. Similarly, Pope Benjamin II visited in 1330 AD (694 years ago) en route to the Monastery of Saint Bishoy to oversee repairs following termite damage to its wooden structures.

Around 1413 AD (611 years ago), the relics of Saint John the Short were transferred to the Monastery of Saint Macarius after his original monastery's roof collapsed due to termite damage.[40]

The monastic life in Wadi El-Natrun gradually declined in the following centuries. Restoration efforts for the Monastery of Saint Macarius began in 1929 AD (95 years ago), marking the start of a revival in the region.[41]";

This refers to the Church and Monastery of Saint Theodore Stratelates (also sometimes known as Deir Tadrus el-Shatby) located in Old Cairo (Coptic Cairo).

Here's what's notable about it:

The Saint: ""El Amir Tadros El Meshreky"" means ""Prince Theodore the Easterner"". This refers to Saint Theodore Stratelates, a renowned military saint and martyr in the Coptic Orthodox tradition (distinct from Saint Theodore the Recruit, though both are highly venerated). ""El Amir"" means ""the Prince"" or ""the Commander,"" fitting for a military saint, and ""El Meshreky"" means ""the Easterner,"" helping to distinguish him.

Location: It is situated within the historic complex of Coptic Cairo, an area rich with ancient churches, monasteries, and historical sites, built within and around the Roman fortress of Babylon.

Nature of the Site: While historically referred to as a ""Deir"" (monastery), today it functions primarily as a significant active church within the cluster of Coptic Cairo sites. It has monastic origins and likely contained monastic cells historically, and may still house some clergy or monks attached to the church, but it's not a large, secluded monastic community in the same sense as the desert monasteries.

Historical Significance: Like many sites in Coptic Cairo, its history is very deep, potentially dating back many centuries, built upon earlier foundations. It's part of the continuous presence of the Coptic Church in Egypt's capital region.

Features: The site includes the Church dedicated to Saint Theodore Stratelates, and often features elements typical of Coptic churches: icons, an iconostasis (hajez), and possibly older architectural remains reflecting its long history.

In summary, Deir El Amir Tadros El Meshreky in Cairo is the Church and Monastery of Saint Theodore Stratelates in Old Cairo, a historically important, active church dedicated to a prominent Coptic military saint, located within the ancient heart of Cairo's Coptic community.";

The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.[3]

History
The Hanging Church was probably built during the patriarchate of Isaac, though an earlier church building may have elsewhere existed dating as early as the 3rd or 4th century. However, the earliest mention of the church was a statement in the biography of the patriarch Joseph I (831–849), when the governor of Egypt visited the establishment. The church was largely rebuilt by the Pope Abraham (975–978) and has seen many other restorations including an extensive repair and restoration of the church and its surroundings completed in 2011.[4] Objects of historical interest that were no longer of service went to the Coptic Museum. A set of 10 wooden panels from a door at the church that were engraved with Christian iconography in 1300 AD can be found in the British Museum.[5]

The Babylon Fortress was a citadel built by the Romans and its origin is disputed by Coptic historians. Some date its origin to the nineteenth century B.C, after Pharaoh Sesostris defeated the Babylonians and took the prisoners of Egypt as slaves. The prisoners rebelled, building a fortress around their home which became known as Babylon. Others believe the fortress was built in the late sixth century B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after conquering Egypt. The Hanging Church was erected over the citadel's old south Bastions, which marked the main gate to the fortress, and gives the church its ‘hanging’ feature. Beneath the church is the old atrium entrance, with niched walls that once contained statues. Superimposed columns and brick arches were later added to provide reinforcement for the building.[6]

The Hanging Church is among the earliest churches in Cairo, competing only with Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, or Abu Sargah.[1] The church was restored in the sixth century, erasing much of the evidence of the church's origin. Carved reliefs, believed to belong to the earlier structure, closely resemble those found in the first Syrian churches, which can be dated to the third or fourth century.[1] There is also a carved beam over the entranceway which can be dated to 284 AD., the starting date for the Coptic era.  

In 840 AD, governor Ali ibn Yahia the Armenian partially destroyed the church during a conflict with the patriarch Anba Yusab. It was later converted into a mosque until the tenth century, when it was reconsecrated. In the eleventh century, the Hanging church became the residence of the Coptic patriarchate, previously in Alexandria.[6]

Pope Abraham (975-978) commissioned one of the first major restorations of the church. The church has also undergone restorations during the reigns of Caliph Haroun El Rasid, El-Aziz Bi'Allah Al Fatemi and Al-Zaher Al Eazaz Din Allah. In 1983, the chapel ceiling collapsed when an engineer had removed an interior column, damaging much of the artwork inside. The 1992 Cairo earthquake caused further damage to the walls of the structure, leading to an additional restoration in 1998 that was completed in 2011.[7] The Hanging Church is also referred to as the Suspended Church or Al-Moallaqa. It is called the Hanging Church because it was built on the southern gate of the Roman Fortress. Logs of palm trees and layers of stones were constructed above the ruins of the Roman fortress to be used as a fundament. The Hanging Church is a unique church and has a wooden roof in the shape of Noah’s ark. From the 7th century to the 13th century, the Hanging Church served as the residence of the Coptic Patriarch. Al-Moallaqa has witnessed important elections and religious ceremonies.

The famous miracle of moving the Moqattam Mountain is closely related to al-Moallaqa. Al-Mu’izz, a Fatimid khaliph, asked Patriarch Abraham (975-978), the 62nd Patriarch, to prove the truth of a verse in the Bible. Al-Mu’izz asked Patriarch Abraham to move the Moqattam Mountain in order to prove the words of the gospel “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence to yonder place, and it shall remove“ (Matthew 17-20).
After three days of praying and fasting in front of the painting of the Virgin Mary depicted on a column in al-Moallaqa, the Virgin Mary appeared to Patriarch Abraham in a vision and told him what to do. The painting of the Virgin Mary exists in the church to this day. Al-Mu’izz was convinced of the truth of the Christian belief and allowed the Coptic Church certain privileges.

There are three sanctuaries at the eastern side of the church, the one in the middle is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the one to the left is named after St. George and the one to the right is named after John the Baptist. Inside the sanctuaries painted baldachins are placed above the altars.
The wooden screen is a unique piece of art and richly decorated with geometric patterns and crosses in ebony and ivory.

The wooden screen is crowned by precious icons, in the center the enthroned Jesus, on the left side the Virgin Mary, Archangel Gabriel and St. Peter, on the right side John the Baptist, Archangel Michael and St. Paul.
15 icons describe the life and torture of St. George, 7 icons give an insight into the life of John the Baptist.

The impressive pulpit of the Hanging Church is from the 5th century and rests on 15 gracile columns. On each side of the pulpit a cross is depicted above three steps symbolizing the three days during which Jesus Christ was in his tomb and his resurrection.

There is an icon of St. Mark on the southern wall of the main church (St. Mark is the first Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church).

A total of 110 icons are kept in the Hanging Church, the oldest of which is the “Coptic Mona Lisa” dating back to the 8th century A.D. and representing Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. Numerous altar icons date back to the 18th century A.D.

There is a door at the south-eastern corner of the church leading to the oldest part of the building. This part has three sanctuaries at the eastern side. The one in the middle is called after St. Dimiana, the one to the left is named after St. Takla Hymanot (an Ethiopian saint), and the one to the right is named after St. Andrew.

Beside these sanctuaries is the baptistery.

There is also a fresco on the eastern wall of the chapel showing the Nativity (the birth of Christ) and the mid wife Salome, next to it a second fresco of 24 men of the apocalypse. Furthermore, on the first floor a church dedicated to St. Mark.";

Old Cairo comprises six ancient churches, a Jewish Synagogue which was previously a Coptic church named after the angel Gabriel, the Coptic Museum and our convent, St. George.

These are the words spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ to St. George before his martyrdom. From the manuscript of St. George kept in St. George’s Convent in Old Cairo:

“I swear by myself, my beloved George, that as there was no one borne of woman greater than John the Baptist, also no martyr resembles you. You will have no counterpart among them. I made your name spread in my kingdom and gave it grace and made it a port of safety for all mankind. Whoever, in distress, calls on your name, either man or woman, I will quickly answer and give them their heart’s request.”

At the entrance, one set of stairs lead to the shrine and the other lead upstairs to where the nuns live. Within this entrance hall is a mosaic icon of the great martyr St. George made in January 1988. The design is copied from a historical icon which is present in the convent.

This ancient icon of St. George dating back to the 19th century is painted in the style of Greek iconography. It depicts the seven crowns that the Great Martyr won for the seven full years of torture before his martyrdom. In the upper part of the icon are two angels descending from heaven. The angel on the right holds six crowns with his left hand while together, the two angels place the seventh crown on St. George’s head. This proves the promise of God to him.

The historical shrine of St. George comprises the main hall, which dates back to the 10th century. The hall consists of seven rooms with wooden doors leading into them. All the doors are decorated with detailed carvings. The wooden ceilings, also delicately carved, are supported by stone arches. The seven rooms adjoined to the hall resemble a hermitage. Some historians (Russle, Coqqin, Lezine) say they were used as private rooms for the nuns.

In an oblong shape of 23 m long and 9 m wide, it also includes numerous architectural units and decorative doors and windows. The most important of these is the huge door measuring almost 7.6 m high and flanked by two smaller doors. These doors lead to the interior compartment of the martyr’s shrine.

The huge ancient door leading from the main hall to the interior partitioned sections is one of the rarest wooden doors found in the world. Dating back to the 10th century, it is 7.6 m high and 2.22 m wide. It consists of an external framework and four panels. The total height of the panel is a single piece divided into units with ornamental wooden fillers.

Part of the frieze on the south ceiling of the main hall contains verses from Psalm 91: “Whoever dwelleth under the defense of the Most High”. The words that appear in the picture are “…to keep thee in all thy ways”.

Within the shrine itself, relics of St. George’s martyrdom are kept from his trial under the Persian King Dadianos. 70 rulers were gathered to cast judgement on St. George’s faith and sentenced him to be tortured. They used all sorts of torturing instruments as well as a chain to which he was tied during his tortures. This chain is a cause of blessing because it was put on the body of the martyr where his blood ran. We believe that the things that touch the bodies of saints become a blessing, as the Bible said about Paul: “So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them” (Acts 19:22).

This chain is found in the middle section of the shrine. Through it, and by faith, many miracles take place and evil spirits are overcome.

The new library of the convent was established in 1995 and contains many different books and manuscripts. It was designed on two levels with an audio-visual library.

History
The origins of the monastery are obscure but are believe to date from the seventh century. The main hall of the monastery dates from the tenth century and displays a tall door, some 7.6 meters, that leads to the interior of the building. Off the main hall is a room, set aside as a shrine, that according to tradition contains the chains that were placed on St. George as part of the tortures to which he was sentenced after his trial under the Persian King Dadianos.

From 1660 to 1800 the church was the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. In 1660 Pope Matthew IV of Alexandria transferred the seat from Ḥārat Zūwayla to Ḥārat al-Rūm,[3] where it remained until 1800 when Pope Mark VIII transferred the patriarchal seat to Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Azbakeya.

Importance
Saint Mary Church grew in importance as the centre of the Coptic Church. Several Coptic Popes are buried in the church.

History
The church was rebuilt several times, and in 1794 Ibrahim El-Gohary renovated the church. It was damaged by fire during the reign of Pope Mark VIII (1797–1809) but was restored and rebuilt.";

One of these churches, dedicated to Saint Mercurius, and is the largest in the district of ancient Babylon.[2]

The church is named after St. Philopater Mercurius who is known as Abu Sayfayn (""double sworded"").

Importance
The Church of Saint Mercurius served as the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria between 1300 and 1500 AD and is perhaps the only one in Cairo with its original foundation intact. It stands 31.5 meters long by 21 meters wide.

Many Coptic patriarchs resided in the church during the 11th through the 15th centuries, and later during the 16 and 18th centuries, others were consecrated in the Church of St. Mercurius. The church also came to be the final resting place for many church leaders.[2]

Church building
The Church of Saint Mercurius itself was demolished and turned into a sugarcane warehouse, but was rebuilt by Patriarch Abraham (974–979).[3] Afterwards, in 1080, 47 bishops met in the church by order of the Fatimid vizier Badr Al-Gamal to establish the Coptic canons.[2] A mob burned it to the ground in 1168, but by 1176, it had been rebuilt.[3]

Flanking the doorway are two Corinthian columns, while situated above it are two icons, one of Jesus Christ and the other the Holy Virgin.[3] The central sanctuary screen consists of ebony inlaid with crosses and squares of thin plated ivory.[3] The choir holds sixty-three icons made by Orhan Karabedian, while the nave contains a beautiful ambon consisting of mosaics which rest on fifteen columns.[3] The south sanctuary, which had been dedicated to Saint Gabriel, was converted into a baptistry, while the north sanctuary, decorated with ivory and wood, is consecrated to the Holy Virgin.[3] A stairway off the north aisle leads to an underground shrine.[3] Saint Barsum the Naked stayed here for twenty years, dying in 1317.[3] A service is held in the shrine on his feast day.[3]

The shrine of the former abbess and Saint of the monastery Mother (Tamav) Irini.

Like many other old Coptic Orthodox churches that were rebuilt and restored time and again over the centuries, often re-using wood and stone-work. For this reason some parts of a church maybe of earlier date than the structure itself. Although they differ in size and architecture features they bear the unmistakable stamp of a Coptic church.";

The Monastery itself is located in the desert, facing the fertile plain, about fifteen kilometers from Dairut, north of Aysut (Assiut). Bawit is actually an ancient, deserted monastery known as the Monastery of St. Apollo (Deir Abu Abullu). Its name probably comes from the Coptic term, Auht, which means ""assembly"", ""congregation"", or ""Monastery"". The first monastery built at this location in Middle Egypt was the work of a monk known as Apollo, and probably dated to the second half of the fourth century (probably between 385 and 390 AD). We are not sure who compiled the ""History of the Egyptian Monks"", an ancient Christian reference, but apparently he knew Apollo personally, and says of him:

""We visited another holy man, named Apollo, in the territory of Hermopolis... Now we saw this man, who had hermitages under him in the desert at the foot of the mountain, and was the father of five hundred monks. He was renowned in the Thebiad and great works were ascribed to him, and the Lord performed many wonders through him, and a multitude of signs were accomplished at his hands. Since from childhood he had given proof of great ascesis, at the end of his life he received the following grace: when he was eighty years old he established on his own a great monastery of five hundred perfect men, almost all of them with the power to work miracles. When he was fifteen years old, he withdrew from the world and spent forty years in the desert, scrupulously practicing every virtue. Then he seemed to hear the voice of God saying to him, 'Apollo, Apollo, through you I will destroy the wisdom of the wise men of Egypt, and I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent pagans' (cf. Is. 29:14). And together with these you will also destroy the wise men of Babylon for me, and you will banish all worship of demons. And now make your way to the inhabited region, for you will bear me 'a peculiar people, zealous of good works.' (Tit. 2.14) ... He set off for the inhabited region... and for a while he lived in the neighboring desert. he occupied a small cave and dwelt there at the foot of the mountain. His work consisted in offering prayers ot God throughout the day, and in bending his knees a hundred times in the night and as many times again in the day. He... [was] living in the power of the Spirit and performing signs and wonderful miracles of healing. These were so amazing that they defy description.... Many monks flocked to him from every quarter because of his renown; and inspired by his teaching and manner of life, a vast number of people renounced the world. A community of brothers formed itself around him on the mountain, as many as five hundred of them, all sharing a common life and eating at the same table""

Desert Fathers, 70-73 Little of the original monastery remains. However, during the sixth century, a community of women associated with St. Rachel also settled within the structures and a new period of building began. The monastery appears to have actually reached its zenith during the seventh century, when there were as many as five thousand monks. After the Arab conquest of Egypt during the seventh century AD, the population of the monastery slowly declined until from the tenth (or eleventh) century on, there were apparently no monks left to hold back the sands of the desert, which now cover most of the deserted buildings. The Bawit complex, though mostly gone now, is known the world over because of the abundance of architectural and painted decorations that were recovered there. Many of these items now reside in either the Louvre Museum in Paris, or in the Coptic Museum in Cairo. Excavations of this monastery were carried out by French archaeologists during the early part of the twentieth century. This work revealed at least two churches and other groups of buildings, along with parts of walls. Judging from the enclosure walls, the monastery was enormous, as they stretched on for some three kilometers in length. The two churches discovered at the center of the complex were simply termed the ""north"" and ""south"" churches. We appear to have little information on their dedication.

However, the south church has been mostly freed from the sand and even partially reconstructed. Engraved text, apparently on the lintel to an entrance, associates the archangels Michael and Gabriel with the founding fathers of the monastery (Apollo and his companion, Abbot Phib). It was apparently built during the sixth century over an earlier edifice from the fourth century. The earlier structure was perhaps not a place of worship at all, while the second structure presents all the characteristics of a basilica church, with a nave, two side aisles, a sanctuary with a niche, and the entrance on its south and north sides. At one time, there were decorations carved in stone and wood and painted friezes with geometrical, vegetal and figurative motifs that ran along the interior and exterior walls of the building. The nearby north church seems to date from the eighth century, and like the south church, appears to be a transformation of a previous building.";

It is dedicated to Saint Menas. The modern monastery is built close to the ruins of Abu Mena, the original pilgrimage site dating from the mid-7th century.
History
Following the execution of Saint Mina, his sister brought his body to a church in Alexandria. When the time of persecution ended, during the papacy of Pope Athanasius of Alexandria, an angel appeared to the Pope and ordered him to load the saint's body on a camel and head towards the Western Desert. At a certain spot near a water well at the end of Lake Mariout, not far from Alexandria, the camel stopped and wouldn't move. The Christians took this a sign from God and there buried Saint Mina's body after placing it in a silver coffin. The coffin was later placed inside decay-resistant wood and buried at the same location.
Most versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. A shepherd was feeding his sheep in that location, and a sick lamb fell on the ground. As it struggled to get on its feet again, its scab was cured. The story spread quickly and the sick who came to this spot recovered from whatever illnesses they had just by lying on the ground. The Ethiopian Synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding Mina's body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor Zeno, but archaeologists have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century.[1] According to the Zeno version, his daughter was leprous and his advisors suggested that she should try that place, and she did. At night Saint Mina appeared to the girl and informed her that his body was buried in that place. The following morning, Zeno's daughter was cured and she related her vision about the saint to her servants. Zeno immediately ordered Mina's body to be dug out and a cathedral to be built there.
A large city was also built there and named after the saint. Sick people from all over the world used to visit that city and were healed through the intercessions of Saint Mina, who became known as the Wonders' Maker. Today, numerous little clay bottles on which the saint's name and picture are engraved are found by archeologists in diverse countries around the Mediterranean world, such as Heidelberg in Germany, Milan in Italy, Dalmatia in Croatia, Marseille in France, Dongola in Sudan, and the holy city of Jerusalem. Visitors would buy these bottles, usually containing oil or water for blessing, and take them back to their relatives.";

Spanning approximately two feddans, the monastery contains five churches, including the Church of Saint Pishoy, the largest church in Wadi El Natrun. Additional features include a guesthouse, expansive gardens, a library, an ancient refectory, and the Well of the Martyrs, as well as apartments where monks reside.[7] Pope Shenouda III often visited the monastery for seclusion, sometimes as a form of symbolic protest against various issues.[8]

History
The Monastery of Saint Pishoy, initially established as a monastic community under Saint Pishoy in the late 4th century AD, is one of the oldest monastic settlements in Wadi El Natrun. Founded contemporaneously with Saint Macarius the Great, the monastery originally comprised a cluster of monks' apartments and a central church built around Saint Pishoy's cave, with no defensive walls.[9]

In 407 AD, the church was destroyed in a raid by Libyan Bedouins, marking the first of several such incursions. Subsequent attacks in 434 and 444 AD caused further destruction,[10] and a fourth Berber raid in the late 6th century severely damaged the church and the fortified tower. Restoration efforts were led by Pope Benjamin I in 645 AD, which included rebuilding both structures.[11]

Another raid occurred in 817 AD, prompting further repairs by Pope Jacob I, while Pope Joseph I returned the relics of Saints Pishoy and Paul of Tammah to the site and oversaw the construction of the main church,[12] which dates back to 840 AD.[13] In 1069 AD, the Berber Luata tribe invaded the monastery, leading to additional reconstruction under Pope Benjamin II in 1319 AD, who was later interred in the main church. The monastery was noted by the historian Al-Maqrizi in the 15th century for its extensive grounds, despite being in a state of disrepair.[14]

During the papacy of Pope Shenouda III, the Monastery of Saint Pishoy underwent renovations. He initiated the restoration of the monks' apartments and repaired the water well where the Berbers had washed their swords after the massacre of the Forty-Nine Martyrs of Scetis. Additionally, Pope Shenouda allocated approximately 300 acres of surrounding desert for land reclamation, established a private papal retreat, and facilitated the introduction of electricity to the monastery.[15]

Notably, the holy oil of chrism (myron) was prepared at the monastery five times during his tenure, specifically in 1981, 1987, 1990, 1995, and 2008. This myron was distributed to Coptic churches both within Egypt and abroad, highlighting the monastery's role in the broader Coptic Orthodox community during his leadership";

The most important location related to the Holy Family is Kom Maria ‘the hill of Maria’, a slightly elevated hill of sand just outside the village , where the Holy Virgin is said to have rested. Kom Maria is less than one kilometer from the fifth century Church of Abu Hinnis, it was founded by St. John the Short, a Coptic hermit and saint who once lived in Wadi Al-Natrun, but fled to this area in 407 A.D. after the Wadi had been attacked by raiders.

Remarkable in this area are the dozens of sixth century hermit caves and the rock-cut church in the mountains between Dayr Abu Hinnis and Dayr al-Barsha. On walls of caves, one will see the beautiful muruals of the archangel instructing Joseph to take the Holy Family to Egypt, and the King Herod giving orders to slay the children of Bethlehem. These are among the oldest murals in the world depicting the Fight into Egypt.

The area of Kom Maria and Dayr Abu Hinnis is usually quiet with only a few people coming for prayer. But, if you go there in January, when the church commemorates the murder of the children of Bethlehem or in June, when the feast of the Holy Family takes place. You will witness an unsurpassed celebration. The bishop of Mallawi will decide the the exact days of the celebrations every year. On the celebration day, the Bishop will cross the Nile in a boat decorated with paintings of the Holy Family. He then will walk with the congregation in a very heart-touching procession with icons and singing deacons through the village ending at Kom Maria.";

In the time of the mass, if this piece gives a lot of water so this year will be at prosperity but if it gives a little of water this year will be in famine.  It is considered one of the oldest Coptic monasteries in El Fayoum probably established in the 4th century by Bishop Aur the first. The foundation of the monastery is related to the Coptic legend of Aur the illegitimate son of the queen’s daughter and Abashit the magician. Throughout this story the angel GABRIEL appears as the guardian of Aur ,who was led to the mountain of al-Naqlun ,where he built a church of Saint Gabriel. Later, Aur was ordained priest and consecrated bishop of the monastery from the 4th to the 6th centuries. Also Saint Samuel escaped with other monks to the mountains in this area for about three and a half years.

The Fayoum remains today a microcosm of archaic Egypt, with temples and pyramids, together with representative monuments from both the Christian and early Islamic periods. Settled many Greeks in late antiquity, the Fayoum became a major holdout during the Christian period and there are a number of important monasteries in the region, including the 7th century Monastery of the Archangle Gabriel and the Monastery of St. Samuel. Another is the Monastery of the Holy Virgin, sometimes called the Monastery of Anba Ishaq (Father Isaac, Deir Abu Ishaq), the Monastery of the Dove, or Deir al-Hamam (Hammam)

This monastery is thought to date as far back as the third century. Coptic traditions holds that it was founded by Saint Issac of Tiphre, one of the disciples of Saint Anthony (known for a monastery dedicated to him in the Eastern Desert), who is known as the father of monasticism. Father Isaac is not one of the better known hermits, despite the fact that evidence suggests he actively spread the idea of Antonian monasticism. Surviving documentation evidences that he was a native of a village near Memphis who, after having a vision, submitted his life to piety and prayer in the desert.

Another View of the Monastery

Traditional accounts hold that an angel of the Lord appeared to Saint Anthony and told him to go to the desert in the Fayoum, where he would find a community of holy men who would listen to his call. Anthony then left the Red Sea coast, setting off in the direction of a certain Lake Arsanius. He crossed the lake by walking on its waters to the opposite shore, and came to the place where the hermit Isaac lived. Anthony then asked Isaac to call together all the other hermits in the area and they formed a congregation in the ""Church of the Angel"", a rock-hewn cave that exists to this day. There Saint Anthony anointed the hermits, declared the whole congregation to be monks.

Isaac, who had originally lived as an anchorite (a solitary hermit), then took on the role of a spiritual leader. He went first to the Gabal Al-Barmil area of Giza (just outside Modern Cairo), then moved to the monastery now named after him in Mofset (Enfast). In each place Isaac introduced Anthony's style of monasticism, encouraging the isolated hermits to lead a semi-communal life. Finally, he went to Gabal Al-Khazain, near Alexandria, where he lived until his death in 356. We are told that he was put to death during the persecutions of Diocletian, by order of Arianus, governor of the Thebiad (area surrounding Thebes), after being horribly tortured. His martyrdom is commemorated on Bashans 6 (May 1).

After Isaac's death, it is believe that his relics were brought to this monastery in the Fayoum.

The 13th century Arab historian named Abu Makarem first mentioned the Monastery of the Holy Virgin, telling us that it was spacious, well located and had fine architectural elements. From the 13th century writings of Abu Salih, the Armenian, we learn of this monastery at a place he calls Hajar al-Lahun:

""Here is the monastery of Saint Isaac; and the church named after the Lady, the Pure Virgin Mary. This church is spacious and beautifully planned, skillfully built and designed, and resembles the church in the monastery of Al-Kalamun. In the [monastery of Saint Isaac there is also a church, named after the glorious martyr Saint Isaac. Round this monastery there is a triple wall of stone. It is much visited, and stands on the mountain to the north of Al-Lahun, at the place called Barniyudah, in the mountain-range in the south of the Fayyum.""

However, it was later deserted and fell into ruin. The famous Egyptologist, William Flinders Petrie visited the monastery in the 19th century, noting that it was inhabited by a married priest and his family. At that time, he dated the monastery to the sixth century, but he also tells us of a visit by Johann Georg, the duke of Saxony, who visited it just before him and dated the monastery to the eighth century.

Petrie also observed that there were the outlines of a much larger monastery about the current one. He mentions that there were rubbish mounds where valuable scraps of papyrus might be found, but alas we know nothing more about this today.

Some say that the Monastery of the Holy Virgin, with its three white domes, is the most picturesque monastery in the Fayoum, though it is not particularly easy to reach. Hence, until recently, few people visited this ancient monastery, which has now been renovated. It is beautifully situated in the desert on the edge of the Nile Valley about eight kilometers northwest from the village of al-Lahun. One must travel over about five miles of desert track in order to reach the monastery.

This is a fairly small monastery, originally built of unbaked mudbrick, the remains of which can still be seen today. One of the most distinctive features of the monastery became its eastern wall, which was covered with a thick layer of wasp's nest while the structure was uninhabited. However today the monastery has been re-populated and the most of these insects have gone, though their mud hives have become an interesting mark upon the structure. Still, there is some return of the wasps between January 10th and March 10th of each year.";

The monastery was most likely built around the burial site of Saint Fana. His tomb was found during excavations of an international team representing seven European academic institutions and led by Austrian scholar Prof. Dr. Helmut Buschhausen in 1992.[1]

The 12th-century historian Abu al-Makarim mentions the church of Saint Fana, which was restored by al-Rashid Abu Fadl.[2] Egyptian historian of the 14th–15th century al-Maqrizi wrote about the monastery's fine architecture.[3]

The history of the Patriarchs of Alexandria mentions the monastery of Saint Fana twice, first in relation to the election of Pope Theodosius III of Alexandria of the Coptic Orthodox Church, 1294–1300 and second to the childhood of Pope Matthew I of Alexandria, 1378–1408.

In pre-Islamic times, the monastery reportedly numbered some 1000 monks. The monastery's numbers had drastically dwindled before the arrival of Islam in the seventh century. Al-Maqrizi reports that during his day, the monastery held only two monks. The French Jesuit priest Father Michel Marie Jullien (1827–1911) reported that the priest of the neighboring village Qasr Hur had cleared the church of debris and used the church for the Divine Liturgy.[4]";

The beginnings of the monastery date back to the end of the 3rd century or the beginning of the 4th century until the time of the Christian persecution under Emperor Diocletian. According to a Coptic manuscript about the martyrdom of St. Psote, at that time hermits were already living in the caves along the valley of Qalamūn.[1] Later, probably in the 5th century, these hermits as Cenobites formed a monastic community. From the life story of St. Samuel, who was written by his successor Isaak, can be seen that he came upon a deserted church and restored the church and the monk's cells. He built a new church for the saint. First income was obtained with the sale of basket-ware. The monastery experienced a considerable upswing. When Samuel died 695 at the age of 98 years, about 120 monks lived in the monastery.

The monastery was plundered several times by Bedouins during Samuel's lifetime, but also during the following centuries. In spite of difficult times, the monastery continued and at the turn of the 13th century flourished with 130 monks and twelve chapels, as reported by Abu Ṣaliḥ, the Armenian historian Abu el-Makarim. One of the churches was consecrated to the Blessed Virgin. The monastery was surrounded by a large wall with four defensive and residential towers and encompassed a large garden next to the chapels. A monk named Muhna lived in a cave of Gebel el-Qalamūn. Possibly the monastery was already in decline in the 14th century. In 1353 the relic of St. Ischkirun was moved from el-Qalamun to the Monastery of St. Macarius in Wadi Natrun.[2] Pope Gabriel V, the 88th patriarch and pope of Alexandria (1409-1427), came from this monastery. Until the report of the Arab historian al-Maqrizi (1364-1442), there are hardly any other sources. In his time the monastery was still inhabited. Al-Maqrizi mentioned two of the four towers and two sources. A rather unusual note on the monastery can be found in a treasure-digging book from the 15th century, the ""Book of buried pearls and valuable secrets for hints of hiding places, finds and treasuries.""

The monastery is located on the top of the mountain on the eastern bank of the Nile River in the city of Samalout – Minya Governorate.

All the books about the Holy Family in Egypt mentioned their visit to this church, as mentioned by many travelers and historians, including Shabashti in the 10th century AD, Abu al-Makarem in the 12th century AD, and al-Maqrizi in the 15th century AD.

Church Shape

The church was originally a Roman temple with an entrance from the eastern side, according to the architectural historian Robert Curzon in his book “Visits to the Monasteries.” The staircase that led to the Roman temple was discovered in the mountain in 2016.

Accordingly, the Holy Family saw this deserted place and the stairs, so it went up and rested in this place for 3 days. After 300 years, the temple was converted into a church in the fourth century 328 AD with the help of Queen Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine. Her team kept the rocky walls and columns and added other elements to suit and employ them in religious rituals as a church.

The layout of the church is basilican, which consists of a nave surrounded by 12 pillars carved in the rocks, with two aisles on the north and south sides, a western corridor, and a transverse corridor as the khorus.

There is the middle sanctuary with an altar named after Virgin Mary, and the northern sanctuary with an altar named after the martyr Demiana. The sanctuaries are connected to each other with a small opening. As for the archaeological cave in which the Holy Family rested, is located to the south of the middle sanctuary, and it is carved in the rock.

The church had two entrances before 1928, one on the western side and the other on the northern side, but it was closed to place the baptistery in front of it.

During the reign of Anba Thomas, Metropolitan of Minya and Ashmunayn chair, 1924 AD, other architectural elements were added to the church, and extra work was done during the era of Anba Sawiris, Bishop of the Minya and Ashmunayn chairs, 1938 AD. These added elements are the external western entrance, the external southern entrance, as well as a concrete roof and the construction of a loft with an additional sanctuary with for martyr Saint george and the Angel. Another concrete roof was made for the domes, the vault, the lighthouse, and the roof.

There is an antique baptistery carved in one of the rock pillars and is no longer used for fear of the impact of the use of water on the pillar. Another baptistery was added in the northern part of the northern corridor of the church’s nave, and that was also canceled in 1980 AD, and a large baptistery was added the western side outside the church building. Anba Befnotios, Bishop of Samalut, established seven new baptisteries in the building attached to the church, and the old baptism became only archaeological.

There is also a circular lantern in front of the western entrance, which is decorated with antique stones carved with the image of Christ and the Apostles and drawings of the vine and fish. In the church there are three archaeological icons, one for the Virgin Mary, another for the martyr Demiana, and a third for the martyr St. George, all of them painted by Anastasiya al-Qudsi al-Rumi in 1554 (martyrs year).

Restoration and maintenance project of Virgin Mary Church in Deir Gabal Al-Tayr

For more than forty years now, this place and what surrounds it are the focus of attention and development from the Diocese of Samalut under the leadership of Anba Befnotios.

The Diocese of Samalout assigned the project to the Scientific Center for Architecture, Coordination and Site Planning “Scale” led by Dr. Eng. Sami Sabry Shaker and a team of engineers, and the office of Prof. Dr. Adel Farid – consultant for the construction works of the project, as well as the office of Dr. Hany Sobhy, electromechanical works consultant. The work is executed and managed by a management team and technicians under the authority of Samalout Archdiocese.

Restoration of the ancient church

The restoration phase was the outcome of many studies and research, that came out with results about the archaeological building, its elements, the environment around it, and the factors affecting it. Hence, work on the project actually began on 8/24/2018, after the approval of the Permanent Committee of Islamic and Coptic Antiquities, held in its session on 4/4/2018, to restore the ancient church, provided that the works will be carried out at the expense of the Diocese of Samalout and under the supervision of the Islamic and Coptic Antiquities Sector and the Projects Sector

The concrete ceiling was removed in both floors and replaced with wooden ones. Restoration of the second floor on the southern area and a wooden ceiling was constructed above it. In addition to restoring the cave area and paving its floor, and restoring the lighthouse structurally and architecturally. Also, the roof vault was dismantled and rebuilt, and during the past months, the restoration of the western corridor and the sanctuaries as well as the northern and eastern outer walls were finished too.";

In the Hellenistic period, Oxyrhynchus was a prosperous regional capital, the third-largest city in Egypt.

The Monastery of Saint Pishoy, initially established as a monastic community under Saint Pishoy in the late 4th century AD, is one of the oldest monastic settlements in Wadi El Natrun. Founded contemporaneously with Saint Macarius the Great, the monastery originally comprised a cluster of monks' apartments and a central church built around Saint Pishoy's cave, with no defensive walls.[9]

In 407 AD, the church was destroyed in a raid by Libyan Bedouins, marking the first of several such incursions. Subsequent attacks in 434 and 444 AD caused further destruction,[10] and a fourth Berber raid in the late 6th century severely damaged the church and the fortified tower. Restoration efforts were led by Pope Benjamin I in 645 AD, which included rebuilding both structures.[11]

Another raid occurred in 817 AD, prompting further repairs by Pope Jacob I, while Pope Joseph I returned the relics of Saints Pishoy and Paul of Tammah to the site and oversaw the construction of the main church,[12] which dates back to 840 AD.[13] In 1069 AD, the Berber Luata tribe invaded the monastery, leading to additional reconstruction under Pope Benjamin II in 1319 AD, who was later interred in the main church. The monastery was noted by the historian Al-Maqrizi in the 15th century for its extensive grounds, despite being in a state of disrepair.[14]

During the papacy of Pope Shenouda III, the Monastery of Saint Pishoy underwent renovations. He initiated the restoration of the monks' apartments and repaired the water well where the Berbers had washed their swords after the massacre of the Forty-Nine Martyrs of Scetis. Additionally, Pope Shenouda allocated approximately 300 acres of surrounding desert for land reclamation, established a private papal retreat, and facilitated the introduction of electricity to the monastery.[15]

Notably, the holy oil of chrism (myron) was prepared at the monastery five times during his tenure, specifically in 1981, 1987, 1990, 1995, and 2008. This myron was distributed to Coptic churches both within Egypt and abroad, highlighting the monastery's role in the broader Coptic Orthodox community during his leadership.[";

The monastery is attributed to Saint Macarius the Great, a disciple of Saint Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism.[2] Macarius retreated to the Wadi El-Natrun desert and is believed to have established his hermitage there in the last third of the 4th century AD.[3] The monastery was once overseen by Pope Shenouda III,[4] following the resignation of Bishop Michael of Assiut, who had served as its abbot for 65 years. After Pope Shenouda’s death in March 2012, the monks requested the reinstatement of Bishop Michael as abbot.[5] He returned to lead the monastery in April 2012 but resigned permanently shortly after.[6] On March 10, 2013, Anba Epiphanius was appointed abbot, a position he held until his assassination on July 29, 2018.[7][8]

The monastery spans an area of approximately 11.34 square kilometers, including its farmlands and associated buildings.[9][10][11][12] It houses seven churches—three within the main complex and four atop the fortress. Additionally, the monastery includes monk cells (known as kelia), a communal dining hall attached to a kitchen, a small museum, a hospital, an power station, a printing press, and a library containing rare manuscripts. There are also accommodations for non-monk staff working within the monastery.[13]

The monastery is renowned for the purported presence of the relics of John the Baptist and the prophet Elisha within the main Church of Saint Macarius. [14] These relics were reportedly discovered during unofficial restoration and expansion works in 1976, overseen by Father Matta El-Meskeen. The find was officially announced in November 1978, sparking controversy, particularly among Muslims, who believe that prophets' bodies do not decay.[15] Moreover, existing Islamic shrines already attributed to these prophets further complicated the matter. Additional controversy arose following a separate discovery in Bulgaria in 2010, where relics claimed to belong to John the Baptist were unearthed beneath an ancient church.

The monastery also contains relics of other saints and patriarchs, adding to its religious and historical importance.[16]";

One of the most prominent of these was the Monastery of John the Little.
The archaeological remains of the Monastery of John the Little is located in Wādī al-Naṭrūn, some 100 km north/northwest of Cairo, close to two ancient but still functioning monastic foundations, the Monastery of the Syrians and the Monastery of St. Bishoi. The monastery takes its name from the fourth-century desert father, John Kolobos (“the Dwarf”), known in Arabic as John the Little (Yūhannis al-qaṣīr), who lived as a hermit in the region and who was renowned for both his humility and his short physical stature. The monastery was perhaps founded after his lifetime and remained one of the most active foundations at Scetis until the medieval period when its population dwindled and it became defunct in the fourteenth century. The site was never reoccupied and today many of the buildings of the monastery still lie largely undisturgbed beneath layers of desert sand, awaiting further archaeological investigation (fig. 1). The earliest archaeological interest in the site was in the 1920s, when Hugh Evelyn White made a basic map of the site as part of his documentation of the four still-functioning monasteries for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1] An Egyptian team excavated the so-called Monastery of the Armenians in the 1980s and 1990s but their work remains unpublished. In 1992, a general survey of the area assessed the potential value of the site for future excavation and was used as a preliminary report for the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) in Egypt.[2]

Systematic archaeological investigation at the Monastery of John the Little was restricted to three seasons conducted by the Michigan-based Scriptorium Center for Christian Antiquities and Calvin Theological Seminary in 1995, 1996, and 1999. These survey and excavation, under the direction of Bastiaan Van Elderen, uncovered the enclosed main Church as well as a hermitage (Residence A) similar to the type of dwellings found at ancient Kellia. Unfortunately, the work of the Scriptorium team was interrupted and their results were never fully published. An architectural study of the Church and Residence A conducted soon after their excavation was published by Bishop Samuil and Peter Grossmann.[3]

These limited explorations showed the potential of this archaeologically-rich desert site to yield new information about a monastic settlement of the late antique to early medieval period in one of the most important monastic centers in Egypt. In addition, the increasing development of the Wadi al-Natrun for agriculture, involving intensive irrigation, indicated that archaeological investigation was urgently needed. Although the site had entered the protection of the SCA in 1983, the 2000s saw the rapid conversion of the desert around the monastery into heavily irrigated fields. 

The Yale Monastic Archaeology Project (YMAP-North), led by Stephen J. Davis (project director and principal investigator) and Darlene Brooks Hedstrom (archaeological director), started work in 2006. Its aim was to document the extent and layout of the monastery through archaeological and geophysical surveys, and to establish the nature of its dwellings and lived experience of monasticism by excavating a midden (trash deposit) and a building (Residence B).  A further goal was to complete the recording and documentation of the monastic dwelling (Residence A) and Church previously excavated by the Scriptorium team. Fieldwork concluded in 2012 and was followed by study seasons for excavated materials in 2013, 2014 and 2017.";

Paromeos Monastery is probably the oldest among the four existing monasteries of Scetes. It was founded c. 335 A.D. by Saint Macarius the Great. The name Pa-Romeos or that of the Romans may refer to Saints Maximus and Domitius, children of the Roman Emperor Valentinian I, who had their cell at the place of the modern monastery. According to Coptic tradition, the two saints went to Scetes during the time of Saint Macarius the Great, who tried in vain to dissuade them from staying. Nevertheless, they stayed and attained perfection before dying at a young age. A year after their departure, Saint Macarius the Great consecrated their cell by building a chapel, and told the monks ""Call this place the Cell of the Romans"". Another theory holds that the name refers to the Roman Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, disciples of Saint Arsenius. The latter was himself a Roman monk who established himself in Scetes, and it is possible that the two emperors had visited their teacher in his seclusion, thus giving to the monastery its name.

Following the destruction of the monastery in 405 A.D. by the Berbers and the Bedouins, Saint Arsenius returned to rebuild it. However, following a second raid also by the Berbers in 410 A.D., he retired to Troe, now a neighbourhood of Cairo known as Tura, where he died.";

St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery (Ukrainian: Михайлівський золотоверхий монастир) was indeed a major and significant religious site in medieval Kyivan Rus'.

Here's a breakdown:

Location: Located in Kyiv, the capital of Kyivan Rus'.
Period: It was founded in the early 12th century, specifically between 1108 and 1113, by Grand Prince Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych of Kyiv. This places it firmly within the later period of Kyivan Rus' and the height of its power and cultural development.
Significance:
Royal Foundation: As a foundation of the Grand Prince, it held high status and was one of the most important churches in Kyiv, alongside the Hagia Sophia of Kyiv.
Patron Saint of Kyiv: It was dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, who became the patron saint of Kyiv.
Golden Domes: It was one of the first churches in Kyivan Rus' to have golden domes, which made it particularly prominent and contributed to the splendor of the Kyiv skyline.
Architectural Style: It followed the architectural traditions of Kyivan Rus', heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture. The main church was likely a cross-in-square plan with multiple domes.
Artistic Value: St. Michael's was particularly famous for its exquisite mosaics and frescoes. These were considered masterpieces of Byzantine art created by masters likely brought from Constantinople or trained under them. Some of these mosaics were tragically lost when the original monastery was destroyed in the 1930s, but notable fragments (like ""Demetrius of Thessaloniki"") were preserved and are now in museums.
Historical Role: It served as a key spiritual center in Kyiv, a burial place for some members of the princely family, and a symbol of the power and piety of the Kyivan rulers.
Regarding ""Ukrainian Orthodox"" in medieval times:

It's important to understand that in the medieval period, the church in Kyivan Rus' was part of the broader Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. There wasn't a distinct ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" in the modern sense. The church in Kyivan Rus' was a single metropolitanate with its center in Kyiv. St. Michael's was a prominent monastery within that medieval Kyivan church tradition, which forms the historical basis for modern Ukrainian Orthodoxy.

Activities in medieval times:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The primary function was housing a large monastic community dedicated to prayer, ascetic practice, and performing the full cycle of Orthodox divine services.
Royal and Princely Support: As a royal foundation, it received continuous support from the Grand Princes, ensuring its wealth and influence.
Artistic Creation: It was a major center for the creation of religious art, particularly mosaics and frescoes, employing skilled masters.
Cultural and Intellectual Hub:
Scriptorium: It would have had a scriptorium for copying religious texts, liturgical books, chronicles (like the Primary Chronicle), and other important manuscripts.
Repository of Knowledge: It housed a significant collection of religious and historical books.
Education: Monasteries often served as centers of education for clergy and sometimes for members of the elite.
Economic Management: Endowed with lands and resources by the princes, the monastery was a significant economic entity managing its estates.
Social and Political Significance: As a major monastery in the capital, linked to the ruling family and dedicated to the city's patron saint, it held considerable social and, at times, political influence.
In summary, St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery was a hugely important medieval religious, artistic, and cultural center in Kyiv, founded by the Grand Prince and renowned for its beauty, particularly its mosaics. It played a vital role in the spiritual life and cultural landscape of Kyivan Rus' during its flourishing period. While the original medieval structure was destroyed and has been meticulously rebuilt in modern times, its significance from the medieval era is well-established.";

It was named for the fifth milestone west of Alexandria along the coastal road between Lake Mareotis and the Mediterranean Sea, probably near present-day al-Maks.[1] It is attested from the early fourth century until the beginning of the seventh. It was one of a series of monastic sites along the coast west of Alexandria, others being the ninth (Enaton), eighteenth (Oktokaidekaton) and twentieth (Eikoston).[2]

The region around the Pempton was called the Eremika, ""desert"" in Greek. In 338, Palladius of Galatia went to live as a hermit there under the spiritual direction of a certain Dorotheos of Thebes, who had been living in a cave there for sixty years. He had built cells for the other brothers living the region. According to Sozomen and Xanthopoulos, writing at some distance, there were around that time 2,000 monks in the coastal monastic centres, including the Pempton. The first writer to record the presence of a monastery at the Pempton is Epiphanius of Salamis, who describes a visionary monk from there who behaved as if he were a bishop.[2]

There are only a few scattered references to the Pempton in the surviving literature. On 18 April 448, an imperial edict condemning Nestorianism and the decree of the prefect of Egypt ordering it to be read were read at the Pempton.[2] During the reign of Justinian I (527–565), according to the Life of Daniel of Scetis, a certain monk of the Pempton for eight years left to play the holy fool in Alexandria, becoming known as Mark the Mad.[3] In the same reign but prior to the death of the Empress Theodora in 548, Anastasia the Patrician founded a monastery either at the Pempton, according to her Greek hagiography, or at the Enaton, according to the Syriac tradition. John Moschos, writing around 600, describes the Pempton as the location of Alexandria's gallows.[2]";

It is dedicated to Saint Menas. The modern monastery is built close to the ruins of Abu Mena, the original pilgrimage site dating from the mid-7th century.

History
Following the execution of Saint Mina, his sister brought his body to a church in Alexandria. When the time of persecution ended, during the papacy of Pope Athanasius of Alexandria, an angel appeared to the Pope and ordered him to load the saint's body on a camel and head towards the Western Desert. At a certain spot near a water well at the end of Lake Mariout, not far from Alexandria, the camel stopped and wouldn't move. The Christians took this a sign from God and there buried Saint Mina's body after placing it in a silver coffin. The coffin was later placed inside decay-resistant wood and buried at the same location.

Most versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. A shepherd was feeding his sheep in that location, and a sick lamb fell on the ground. As it struggled to get on its feet again, its scab was cured. The story spread quickly and the sick who came to this spot recovered from whatever illnesses they had just by lying on the ground. The Ethiopian Synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding Mina's body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor Zeno, but archaeologists have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century.[1] According to the Zeno version, his daughter was leprous and his advisors suggested that she should try that place, and she did. At night Saint Mina appeared to the girl and informed her that his body was buried in that place. The following morning, Zeno's daughter was cured and she related her vision about the saint to her servants. Zeno immediately ordered Mina's body to be dug out and a cathedral to be built there.

A large city was also built there and named after the saint. Sick people from all over the world used to visit that city and were healed through the intercessions of Saint Mina, who became known as the Wonders' Maker. Today, numerous little clay bottles on which the saint's name and picture are engraved are found by archeologists in diverse countries around the Mediterranean world, such as Heidelberg in Germany, Milan in Italy, Dalmatia in Croatia, Marseille in France, Dongola in Sudan, and the holy city of Jerusalem. Visitors would buy these bottles, usually containing oil or water for blessing, and take them back to their relatives.

Destruction of the city of Saint Mina
The city of Saint Mina was destroyed during the Arab invasion of Egypt in the seventh century (source needed.) The cathedral was also damaged. The remains of the city was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Recent agricultural efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the water table, which has caused a number of the site's buildings to collapse or become unstable. ";

The church was dedicated in June 907 and named in honor of the Mother of God. There is no evidence to discern whether the monastery housed males or females upon its foundation, and little is known about the monastery at this time. At the end of the 13th century, Theodora Palaiologina restored the monastery, contributed a second church dedicated to St. John the Forerunner, and built a hospital. If it had not already been so before, Theodora Palaiologina committed the site to female monastic patron. Her typikon proclaims the conventâ€™s independent status even though the convent maintained a close relationship with the imperial family. ; An anonymous Russian pilgrim who visited Constantinople between 1424 and1453 says that south of the church of the Holy Apostles one encountered two nunneries, and in one of these nunneries the body of St. Irene was preserved.

Theodora Palaiologina states in the document that she composed the typikon for the monastery, but an anonymous author actually wrote the document. The author of the typikon likely had access to the typikon of Kecharitomene or a typikon derived from the typikon of Kecharitomene as is demonstrated by the close organizational parallels displayed in the two documents. The typikon was read aloud at the two feast days of the patrons and at Easter. ; Emperor Leo VI (886-912) attended the dedication of the church of the Monastery of Lips in 907. ; The convent maintained a hospital with beds for 12 patients. The hospital employed three doctors, an assistant, a nurse, a pharmacist, two apothecaries, six attendants, a bloodletter, three servants, a cook, and a laundress. ; The monastery's main form of income came from the properties which Theodora Palaiologina and her family endowed to it. ; 50 nuns (1294-1301). 30 of these nuns were assigned to the performance of the canonical hours and 20 were assigned to household duties. Nuns acted as officials in the monastery, namely as superior, cellarer, sacristan, ecclesiarchissa, and assistant to the ecclesiarchissa. The cellarer was primarily concerned with the supply and preparation of food and drink. The sacristan guarded the foundationâ€™s reserve funds. ; Located in the Lykos valley in west-central Constantinople. ; Constantine Lips founded the Monastery of Lips. The monasteryâ€™s church, the Church of the Virgin, was dedicated in June 907. The Church of the Virgin is a cross-in-square structure. Scholars debate whether the structure originally had three aisles or five aisles. At the south end, the church had five polygonal half-cylinders. An abundance of original ornamentation has survived on column shafts, bases, and capitals. The church included a central dome over the nave. Four small, independent chapels rise over the four corners of the church on the second story. Supplicants reached these upstairs chapels using one of two wooden staircases placed on either side of the narthex. ; Icon of Saint Eudokia ; Constantine Lips founded the original Monastery of Constantine Lips and dedicated a church in honor of the Mother of God.

Andronikos chose Irene to be the wife of his nephew, the emperor of Trezibond. This plan failed, and Irene soon married Andronikosâ€™ eldest son, the Despot John Palaiologos, at age 12. Irene and John had a reportedly happy marriage, and Irene had hopes of becoming the Empress, but John died suddenly in 1307 after only 4 years of marriage. After this, Irene turned towards an ascetic life and founded the convent of Christ Philanthropos. She immediately entered the convent and took the name Eulogia, authoring a typikon upon the conventâ€™s foundation (Irene-Eulogia Choumnaina Palaiologina, Abbess of the Convent of Philanthropos Soter in Constantinople, p. 120-122). ; Russian travelers from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries report the existence of the convent and speak of a famous miracle-working image of Christ located there.

Even after the monastery's destruction, local Greek Christians continued to visit the fountain (Russian travelers to Constantinople in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, p. 373-374). ; The convent was associated with a companion male monastery also dedicated to Christ Philanthropos, where Irene's father Nikephoros Choumnos retired (Introduction,Â Philanthropos: Typikon of Irene Choumnaina Palaiologina for the Convent of Christ Philanthropos in Constantinople, p. 1383). As a double monastery, it functioned as a cloister of men and women who formed a single legal entity, who were ruled by one administration, who lived in the same place, and who shared some activities. It is unclear how many activities men and women partook of together. Trone suggests that men and women associated at meals, had a common diet, and did some work together.

Justinian I, a ruler of the Byzantine Empire, ordered the monastery to be repaired in 565, and it was renovated multiple times until the 20th century. The current structures date from the rebuilding in 1410.[2]

Vazelon Monastery was a center of Greek Orthodox life in the Matzouka/Maçka area,[a] retaining some control over surrounding villages until its disestablishment. Frescoes on the north outer walls of the church that depict Heaven, Hell and the Last Judgement have remained for centuries.[7]

The monastery was attacked multiple times throughout its history. In the 500s, Sassanid Persian invaders raided the monastery and destroyed parts of it. They also killed the resident monks.[8] Years later, during World War I, Turkish forces attacked the monastery.[9] Vazelon was abandoned in 1923 following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey.[10] Vandalism has contributed to the monastery's dilapidated state.[11]

Few items remain from the Vazelon's archive. Some documents are now located at the Leningrad Museum, while others are kept by the Turkish Historical Society (TTK).[1] Historians have used these documents to learn about life in the Byzantine Empire and the Empire of Trebizond.

Vazelon was built in Roman times. It was first used in 270[6] or in 317.[10] After the division of the Roman Empire in 395, Anatolia (including Vazelon Monastery) became part of the Byzantine Empire.[12][13] The monastery was attacked and ruined on numerous occasions by invading forces. In the 6th century, it was sacked by the Sassanids, who also killed its residents.[8] Byzantine emperors financed the monastery in the 600s and 700s, allowing it to expand.[14]

During the Fourth Crusade, invaders from Europe sacked Constantinople.[15] This 1204 attack fractured the Byzantine Empire. The Pontus region, to which Vazelon belonged, became the Empire of Trebizond.[16] Trapezuntine emperors continually funded Vazelon throughout the Middle Ages. Vazelon Monastery, along with other large Pontic monasteries, was ""handsomely endowed by the emperors.""[17] The Pontus region remained under Trapezuntine rule until Turkish conquest in 1461.[18] Vazelon continued its religious functions during Ottoman times and into World War I. However, during the Russian occupation of Trabzon in 1916-7, some monastic documents were seized. These remain in St. Petersburg.[14]

Violence occurred at Vazelon Monastery during the last years of World War I. Turkish soldiers rounded up Pontians from around Trebizond Vilayet, brought them to the monastery, and killed them. Some women were raped before being killed.[b][9] The last residents of the monastery were forced out during the Greek/Turkish population exchange in 1923.[10] Most of the native Greek Orthodox who had avoided the Greek genocide were forced to Greece, and Greece's native Muslims were expelled to Turkey.[19] After the population exchange, one monk, Dionysios Amarantidis, took an icon of John the Baptist from Vazelon Monastery. He transferred it to the monastery of Agia Triada in Serres, Greece.[14]

Today, Vazelon sits abandoned. Vandalism has contributed to its dilapidated state.[11] The Leningrad Museum and Turkish Historical Society (TTK) keep what is left of the monastery's archives.[1]";

The monastery was established in its present location in 1940. However, the tradition of the Valamo monastery dates back to 1717. The monastery was then originally established on Valaam (also known historically by the Finnish name Valamo) which is an archipelago in the northern portion of Lake Ladoga, lying within the Republic of Karelia in the Russian Federation.

The New Valamo Monastery is now an active centre of the Orthodox religious life and culture in Finland and welcomes visitors throughout the year.

History
In 1939, during the Winter War, some 190 monks from the Valamo Monastery in Karelia were evacuated from their old abode on a group of islands in Lake Ladoga in the Viipuri Province to present Eastern Finland. The old Valamo Monastery was occupied by the armed forces of the Soviet Union quite soon after the outbreak of the Winter War.

After a temporary dwelling place the monks decided to settle down in Heinävesi in Eastern Finland. The choice fell on a mansion in Papinniemi, Heinävesi, after the monks had found there, quite surprisingly, an icon of St. Sergius and St. Herman of Valaam, the founders of the monastery in the 12th century. The monks considered this to be a sign from God.[1][2] Having received evacuees from the Konevsky (Konevitsa) and Pechenga (Petsamo) monasteries, it is now the only monastery for men of the Finnish Orthodox Church.[3]

In 1977, in connection with the celebration of the 800th anniversary of Orthodoxy in Finland, the stone Transfiguration Cathedral was built in the monastery according to the design of the architect Ivan Kudrjavzev.";

It is one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Greece. The site was previously a citadel of the Knights Hospitaller that functioned as a palace, headquarters, and fortress.

History
According to recent study, in the exact spot in which the palace exists today, there was the foundations of the ancient temple of the sun god Helios, and probably that was the spot where the Colossus of Rhodes stood in the Antiquity.[2][3] The palace was originally built in the late 7th century as a Byzantine citadel. After the Knights Hospitaller occupied Rhodes and some other Greek islands (such as Kalymnos and Kastellorizo) in 1309, they converted the fortress into their administrative centre and the palace of their Grand Master. In the first quarter of the 14th century, they repaired the palace and made a number of major modifications.[4] The palace was damaged in the earthquake of 1481, and it was repaired soon afterwards.

After the 1522 capture of the island by the Ottoman Empire, the palace was used as a command centre and fortress.";

A transnational effort, it has four towers known as the English, French, German, and Italian towers, bearing the names of the nations responsible for their construction. The chapel was built around 1407 and the first walls completed in 1437. The castle started reconstruction in the late 15th century, only to be taken over by the Islamic Ottoman Empire in 1523. The chapel was converted to a mosque, and a minaret was added. The castle remained under the empire for almost 400 years. After remaining empty following World War I, in the early 1960s, the castle became the home for the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology. In 2016 it was inscribed in the UNESCO Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.[1]

History

Stained-glass Knights Hospitaller coats of arms in the English Tower.
Confronted by the now firmly established Ottoman Sultanate, the Knights Hospitaller, whose headquarters were on the island of Rhodes, needed another stronghold on the mainland. Grand Master Philibert de Naillac (1396–1421) identified a suitable site across from the island of Kos, where a castle had already been built by the Order. Its location was the site of a fortification in Doric times (1110 BC) as well as of a small Seljuk castle in the 11th century. The same promontory is also the probable site of the Palace of Mausolos, the famous King of Caria.[2] In his travel diary Travels In Asia Minor, Charles Boileau Elliot describes this palace as the Palace of Mausolus with absolute certainty, and this account was written in the year 1840.


The French Tower.
The construction of the castle began in 1404[3] under the supervision of the German knight architect Heinrich Schlegelholt. Construction workers were guaranteed a reservation in heaven by a Papal Decree of 1409.[4] They used squared green volcanic stone, marble columns and reliefs from the nearby Mausoleum of Halicarnassus to fortify the castle.

The first walls were completed in 1437. The chapel was among the first completed inner structures (probably 1406). It consists of a vaulted nave and an apse. The chapel was reconstructed in Gothic style by Spanish Knights of Malta in 1519–1520. Their names can be found on two cornerstones of the façade. Fourteen cisterns for collecting rainwater were excavated in the rocks under the castle.

Each langue of the Order had its own tower, each in its own style. Each tongue, each headed by a Bailiff, was responsible for the maintenance and defense of a specific portion of the fortress and for manning it with sufficient numbers of knights and soldiers. There were seven gates leading to the inner part of the fortress.

The architect applied the latest features in castle design; the passages leading to the gates were full of twists and turns. Eventual assailants could not find cover against the arrows, stones or heated projectiles they had to confront. The knights had placed above the gates and on the walls hundreds of painted coats of arms and carved reliefs. Two hundred and forty-nine separate designs still remain, including those of grand masters, castle commandants, countries, and personal coat of arms of knights and religious figures.

The construction of the three-storied English tower was finished in 1413. One door opens to the north, to the inner part of the castle, while the other leads to the western rampart. One could only access this tower via a drawbridge. The western façade shows an antique carved relief of a lion. Because of this relief, the tower was also called ""the Lion Tower"". Above this lion, one can see the coat of arms of King Henry IV of England.

For over a century St. Peter's Castle remained the second most important castle of the Order. It served as a refuge for all Christians in Asia Minor.

The castle came under attack with the rise of the Ottoman Empire, first after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and again in 1480 by Sultan Mehmed II. The attacks were repelled by the Knights of St John. In 1482, Prince Cem Sultan, son of Sultan Mehmed II and brother of Sultan Bayezid II, sought refuge in the castle, after a failure in raising a revolt against his brother.


A disused cannon.
When the Knights decided to fortify the castle in 1494, they used stones from the Mausoleum once again. The walls facing the mainland were thickened in order to withstand the increasing destructive power of cannon. The walls facing the sea were less thick, since the Order had little to fear from a sea attack due to their powerful naval fleet. Grand Master Fabrizio del Carretto (1513–21) built a round bastion to strengthen the land side of the fortress. Sir Thomas Docwra was appointed Captain of the Castle in 1499.

16th century
Between 1505 and 1507 the few sculptures from the mausoleum that had not been smashed and burnt for lime were integrated into the castle for decoration. These included twelve slabs of the Amazonomachy (combat between Amazons and Greeks) and a single block of the Centauromachy, a few standing lions, and one running leopard.


Philippe Villiers, who ordered the Castle to be fortified.
When faced with an attack from Sultan Suleiman, Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, ordered the Castle to be strengthened again. Much of the remaining portions of the mausoleum were broken up and used as building material to fortify the castle. By 1522 almost every block of the mausoleum had been removed.

In June 1522 the sultan attacked the Order's headquarters in Rhodes from the Bay of Marmaris with 200,000 soldiers (Siege of Rhodes (1522)). The castle of Rhodes fell in December 1522. The terms of surrender included the handing over of the Knights' fortresses in Kos and St Peter's Castle in Bodrum.

After the surrender, the chapel was converted into a mosque and a minaret was added. This mosque was called the Süleymaniye Camii, as attested by a traveler, Evliya Chelebi, who visited Bodrum in 1671. The minaret was destroyed on 26 May 1915 by rounds fired by a French warship during World War I. It was reconstructed in its original shape in 1997.";

Matejče Monastery (Матејче) in North Macedonia during medieval times. Today it's associated with the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric, but its medieval history is primarily linked to the Serbian Empire and its rulers.

Here's what's notable about Matejče Monastery in the medieval period:

Location: Situated on the slopes of Skopska Crna Gora mountain, near the modern border with Serbia and Kosovo, north of Kumanovo in North Macedonia.

Foundation and Royal Patronage (Mid-14th Century):

Matejče Monastery, dedicated to the Holy Mother of God (Bogoroditsa / Virgin Mary), was largely built and renovated in the mid-14th century.
Its construction is closely associated with the Serbian imperial family. It was initially begun or renovated significantly under Tsar Stefan Dušan, but it is most strongly linked to his wife, Tsaritsa Elena (Empress Helen). After Dušan's death, Tsaritsa Elena resided there for a time and oversaw its completion and decoration. This makes it a significant royal foundation.
Architecture:

The main church is a large and complex structure, characteristic of the grand church architecture of the 14th-century Serbian Empire. It features a five-domed layout (a central dome and four smaller ones) and a developed cross-in-square plan, reflecting the dominant Byzantine architectural influences adapted within the Serbian realm.
Significance of Frescoes:

Matejče is renowned for its magnificent medieval frescoes, painted around the time of its construction and decoration in the mid-to-late 14th century.
These frescoes are considered among the finest examples of the Paleologan style (the artistic style of the late Byzantine period) in the Balkans. They are notable for their vibrant colors, dynamic compositions, and expressive figures.
The frescoes depict various scenes from the lives of the Virgin Mary, Christ, and saints, as well as portraits of the royal donors, including Tsar Dušan, Tsaritsa Elena, and their son Tsar Uroš V. These portraits are valuable historical documents.
Role as a Monastic Center:

Matejče was an important monastery housing a significant community of monks during its medieval peak.
As a major royal foundation, it would have enjoyed prestige and resources, likely serving as a spiritual focal point for the surrounding area.
While not as famous for a scriptorium as some others, major monasteries like Matejče often played a role in preserving religious texts.
Historical Context: During the 14th century, the region where Matejče is located was firmly within the Serbian Empire. The monastery's foundation and lavish decoration were expressions of the power, piety, and cultural ambitions of the Serbian rulers. Ecclesiastically, it would have been under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate, which was established during Dušan's reign.

In summary, during medieval times, particularly in the mid-14th century, Matejče Monastery was a major royal foundation of the Serbian Empire, built under the patronage of Tsar Stefan Dušan and Tsaritsa Elena. It was a significant monastic center known for its impressive architecture and, especially, for its high-quality and extensive medieval frescoes, which are key examples of Paleologan art in the region and include valuable royal portraits. It represented the artistic and spiritual flourishing of the Serbian state in the Balkans at its peak.";

The Monastery of Saint Naum (Macedonian: Манастир „Свети Наум“) is a Macedonian Orthodox monastery. It is named after the medieval Bulgarian[1] writer and enlightener Saint Naum who founded it.[2] The monastery is situated in North Macedonia, along Lake Ohrid, 29 kilometres (18 mi) south of the city of Ohrid, within the boundary of the village of Ljubaništa.

The Lake Ohrid area, including St Naum, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in North Macedonia.[3]

History
The monastery was established in the Bulgarian Empire in 905[4] by St Naum of Ohrid himself. St Naum is also buried in the church.

Since the 16th century, a Greek school had functioned in the monastery.[5] The monastery had close ties with the printing house of Moscopole, a former prosperous Aromanian city now in Albania.[6] The area where the monastery of St Naum[7] lies belonged to Albania from 1912 until June 28, 1925, when Zog of Albania ceded it to Yugoslavia as a result of negotiations between Albania and Yugoslavia and as a gesture of goodwill.[8]";

Lešok Monastery (Лешочки манастир) in North Macedonia during medieval times. Today it's part of the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric, but its medieval history fits within the broader context of Orthodox monasticism in the Balkans during that era, often under various political authorities.

Here's what was notable about Lešok Monastery in the medieval period:

Location: Situated in a prominent location in the Polog Valley, near the town of Tetovo, at the foothills of the Šar Mountains.

Foundation and Early Medieval Period (Likely 14th Century):

The monastery's origins are traditionally placed in the 14th century. Like many monasteries in the region, it likely began with hermitic settlements or a small church.
The main medieval structure that survives, though partially ruined and later restored, is the Church of the Holy Mother of God (Bogoroditsa). This church dates from the 14th century.
Architecture of the Medieval Church:

The Church of the Holy Mother of God is a relatively small but architecturally significant medieval building. Its style reflects the regional architectural trends of the 14th century, often incorporating elements of the Byzantine tradition as interpreted in the Balkans, sometimes with local variations.
Medieval Frescoes:

The church contains layers of frescoes, with the oldest dating back to the 14th century. While some are damaged, these medieval frescoes are important for understanding the artistic currents of the time. They likely feature traditional Orthodox iconography – scenes from the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and various saints. These murals connect Lešok to the wider artistic flourishing seen in the region during the late medieval period (often linked to the Paleologan style).
Role as a Monastic Center:

During the medieval period, Lešok functioned as an active monastic community. Monks lived there, practicing prayer and asceticism.
It would have served as a spiritual center for the local population in the Polog Valley.
While not as renowned as major royal foundations like Lesnovo or Matejče, it was part of the network of monasteries that preserved Orthodox faith and culture in the region.
Historical Context: The Polog Valley in the 14th century was a contested area, part of the Serbian Empire for a time before the Ottoman conquest began to sweep through the Balkans. The monastery existed within this complex political landscape. Ecclesiastically, it would have been under the relevant Orthodox jurisdiction of the time, likely the Serbian Patriarchate after its establishment in the mid-14th century.

Important Note: Lešok Monastery is also very famous for its 19th-century revival led by figures like Kiril Pejčinović, who is buried there. However, this renowned period and the rebuilding activities associated with it occurred long after the medieval era. The medieval significance of Lešok lies primarily in its 14th-century foundation, its surviving Church of the Holy Mother of God with its medieval architecture, and its early layers of frescoes.

In summary, during medieval times, Lešok Monastery was established as a monastic site, likely in the 14th century. Its main medieval contribution was the construction of the Church of the Holy Mother of God, an example of regional medieval architecture containing valuable 14th-century frescoes, serving as a modest but active spiritual and monastic center in the Polog Valley before facing the challenges of the Ottoman era.";

It was built by Savastokrator Vlatko and his father Duke Paskač around 1354.

The monastery, dedicated to St Nicholas the Wonderworker, lies at the end of the village of Psača, 3 km from the Kumanovo – Kriva Palanka Road, in Rankovce Municipality. It belongs to the diocese of Osogovo-Kumanovo of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.

History
The monastery church, the only remaining part of the original monastic complex, was erected around 1354 by Sevastokrator Vlatko and his father Grand Duke Paskač, nobles of the Serbian Empire. In 1358, Vlatko donated his monastery to Chilandar, a Serbian monastery on Mount Athos.[1]

Architecture
The church is in the form of an elongated cross in a square with a narthex built at the same time. It originally had two domes (following the example of Lesnovo monastery), but the one above the nave collapsed at some point, leaving the central part of the church uncovered. In the 19th century the church was repaired but the missing dome was never rebuilt.[2]

The outer decoration is in alternate layers of bricks and stone with several double bay windows and some rustic sculpture. The original dedication of the church was inscribed in stone above the entrance but was destroyed during the Bulgarian occupation of Macedonia in World War I since it mentioned Emperor Uroš and King Vukašin as Serbian rulers.";

Its church is the oldest still standing religious building in Moldavia[citation needed]. The monastery was built by Bogdan I of Moldavia (1359–1365) sometime around 1360. Bogdana Monastery (Mănăstirea Bogdana), situated in Rădăuți, Romania, and its significance for the Romanian Orthodox Church within the context of medieval times.

Bogdana is an exceptionally important monastery because it's considered the first princely foundation and the initial cathedral church of the newly forming Principality of Moldavia.

Here's what was notable about it in the medieval period:

Location: Situated in Rădăuți, in the historical region of Bukovina (part of modern Romania), which was a key area in the early history of the Principality of Moldavia.

Foundation (Mid-14th Century):

The monastery was founded by Voivode Bogdan I around 1360. Bogdan I is a pivotal figure, considered the founder of the independent Principality of Moldavia, having led the movement away from Hungarian suzerainty.
The monastery is dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Founding a large stone church was a way for the new ruler to assert legitimacy, piety, and establish a center of power and identity for his realm.
Role as the First Princely Church and Necropolis:

This is perhaps Bogdana's most significant medieval role. It was built to serve as the princely burial church (necropolis) for the early rulers of Moldavia. Bogdan I himself was buried here, as were other early voivodes and members of their families (like Lațcu, Roman I, Stephen I, Alexander I ""the Good""). This made it a potent symbol of the new state and the legitimacy of its ruling dynasty.
The church is also believed to have initially served as the cathedral church for the first Metropolitanate of Moldavia, which was established around the same time (though the metropolitan seat later moved). This gave it immense ecclesiastical authority in the nascent Moldavian church structure.
Architectural Significance:

The Church of Saint Nicholas at Bogdana is one of the oldest surviving stone churches in Moldavia.
Its architecture is foundational for the development of the distinct Moldavian architectural style that would flourish in the 15th and 16th centuries. It shows influences from both Byzantine traditions (especially through Serbian models) and local Romanesque/Gothic elements. Its triple-apse plan is characteristic.
Monastic Community and Activities:

As a monastery, it housed a community of monks dedicated to prayer, worship, and ascetic life.
As a major princely and metropolitan foundation, it would have been a relatively wealthy and influential monastic center.
It likely maintained a scriptorium for copying liturgical books, religious texts, and potentially historical records, contributing to the preservation of culture and literacy in the early principality.
It would have served as a significant spiritual center for the region and a destination for pilgrims.
Historical Context: Bogdana's medieval history is intertwined with the very act of establishing Moldavia as a sovereign entity. Its foundation and role directly reflect Bogdan I's efforts to create a distinct political and religious center independent of neighboring powers.

In summary, during medieval times, Bogdana Monastery was a critically important institution for the nascent Principality of Moldavia and the Romanian Orthodox Church in that region. Founded by the state's founder, Bogdan I, it served as the first princely burial church, the initial metropolitan cathedral, and a key monastic center. Its architecture represents the beginnings of Moldavian church building, and its existence was a powerful symbol of Moldavian statehood and Orthodox identity.";

The church was founded by the nuns of the Order of Saint Clare, or the Clarisses, and the first written record dates from 1486. In 1543, as in the case of many other monasteries in Transylvania, the Lutherans expelled the order from town, and the whole church as well as the monastery was emptied and used as a granary until 1644 when it was restored to its initial status and was used as a Lutheran place of worship. Context of Brașov (Kronstadt):

Saxon City: Brașov was one of the most important cities founded by German colonists (Transylvanian Saxons) in Transylvania, which was then part of the Kingdom of Hungary.
Catholic Stronghold: The Saxons were staunchly Roman Catholic until the Reformation in the 16th century. The city had significant Catholic institutions.

Franciscan Presence:

The Franciscan Order (Friars Minor) spread throughout the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania, often ministering to German-speaking populations.
A Franciscan friary dedicated to St. John the Baptist existed in Brașov from the 14th century (some sources suggest even earlier, mid-13th century). This is crucial because Poor Clare monasteries were almost always founded in close proximity to or in conjunction with Franciscan friaries, as the friars provided spiritual direction, Mass, and sacraments.
The Poor Clare Monastery in Brașov:

Foundation: Sources suggest a Poor Clare monastery was established in Brașov, likely in the 14th century, possibly evolving from or alongside an earlier Beguine community (Beguines were lay religious women living in community, common in Germanic lands). Some sources pinpoint its foundation around 1340-1350.
Dedication: The exact dedication isn't always readily available in general summaries, but it would have been to a saint (perhaps St. Clare herself, the Virgin Mary, or a locally important saint).
Community: It would have been a community of women, primarily from the local Saxon bourgeois and possibly noble families, who chose to live a life of contemplative prayer and poverty.
Life of the Clarisse Nuns in Medieval Brașov:

Rule of St. Clare: Their lives would have been governed by the Rule of St. Clare, emphasizing:
Contemplative Prayer: The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) chanted in choir, Mass, mental prayer. This was their primary ""work.""
Strict Poverty: Renunciation of all personal and communal property, relying on alms from the citizens of Brașov and the work of their own hands.
Enclosure (Cloister): They would live within the walls of their monastery, with minimal contact with the outside world, to foster an atmosphere of prayer.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess.
Manual Labor: Essential for their sustenance and as a spiritual discipline. This could include:
Spinning and Weaving: Producing textiles for their own use or simple items.
Needlework/Embroidery.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden.
Baking.
Interaction with the City:
They would have prayed for the city of Brașov, its people, and its leaders.
They would have depended on the charity of the local population.
Language: Liturgical Latin, but their common language would have been German.
Challenges and Environment:

Frontier Location: Transylvania was on the edge of Catholic Europe, facing the growing power of the Ottoman Empire from the late 14th century onwards. This would have created a sense of insecurity at times.
Multi-ethnic Region: While Brașov was predominantly Saxon, Transylvania was a mix of Saxons, Hungarians (Szeklers), and Romanians (who were largely Eastern Orthodox). The Poor Clares would have been part of the Catholic, German-speaking milieu.
The Reformation and Dissolution:

The Protestant Reformation took strong hold among the Transylvanian Saxons in the mid-16th century, with Johannes Honterus being a key figure in Brașov.
Like other Catholic monastic institutions in cities that embraced Protestantism, the Poor Clare monastery in Brașov would have been dissolved or secularized during this period (likely around the 1540s-1550s). Its property would have been confiscated and repurposed. The nuns would have been forced to leave or abandon their monastic vows. This marked the end of their medieval presence.";

It is about 6 km (3.7 mi) north of Palekastro and 85 km (53 mi) east of Agios Nikolaos. It is at the base of the Itanos promontory from which Cape Sidero, the easternmost point of Crete, projects to the northeast. The nearest settlements are Sitia to the west and Palaikastro to the southeast; otherwise, the entire promontory is uninhabited except for the modern military reservation at the tip of the cape. In the political structure of Greece, the monastery has been assigned the settlement (oikismos) of Toplou, which it had before 2011, but was validated again in the redivision of 2011. The full civic classification beyond Toplou from 2011 in ascending order is: local community (topike koinoteta) Palaikastro, municipal unit (demotike enoteta) Itanos, municipality (demos) Siteia, regional unit (periphereiake enoteta) Lasithi, region (periphereia) Crete.

Believed to have been founded as early as the 14th century, the monastery was placed on the upper southern slope of Moni Toplou Gorge (named after it), a tortuous, geologically and ecologically interesting ravine exiting into the Sea of Crete through a boulder-strewn declivity called ""the Abbott's Beach"" (he paralia tou hegoumenou).[1] Today the ravine is one of the reasons why the whole area has been incorporated into Sitia Geopark. The original placement was made near a copious spring draining into the gorge, now the site of a windmill-driven pump raising water out of the water table below.

The monastery was founded at a time when the classical city of Itanus, former owners of the promontory, was long gone, abandoned centuries earlier, and forgotten by all except the monks, who continued to be interested in the site. The Ottoman Empire had not yet become ascendant. For reasons unknown or not generally published the monastery inherited the entire territory of the ancient city, which it holds today as a major asset.[2] A corporation has been created for its land holdings, ""The Public Welfare Foundation of Panagia Akrotiriani,"" a subsidiary of the monastery and the Archdiocese of Sitia. The monastery was originally called Panagia Akrotiriani (""Our lady of the Cape),"" a name which apparently is still legally meaningful. Its alternative current name, Moni Toplou, literally means ""place of the cannon"" (Turkish: top), thus called by the Turks for the cannon then mounted over the door.[3] It had that name since at least 1865, when Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt reported on his survey work in Crete, misrepresenting the name as Greek to plou (""the plou,"" whatever ""plou"" might be).

The monastery has this entire time been economically and politically proactive. The monks, dressed in blue robes, under the direction of the Abbott, run a number of businesses. As the main road from Sitia to Vai runs through the premises, the monastery is open to the public for an entrance fee. Temporary hotel space is also available. Within the main gate are a store and a museum. The museum is a repository for many works of art, containing also collections of manuscripts. On the outside, much of the land around the monastery buildings is used for viticulture and dendriculture. They manufacture and export wine and olive oil. The real estate company is currently negotiating other uses of the promontory, but the chief obstacle is the conservation-minded government. Similarly, the cape is theirs but its use is reserved to the military. Some high points of their political proactivity are their support of resistance to the Ottoman Empire and to the Nazi occupation of Crete.

History
Evidence of the early monastery

Original church
The monastery is dedicated to Panagia (Virgin Mary) and St. John the Theologian. The monastery, especially the main building, is a composite of structures resulting from its frequent destruction and consequent rebuilding. Different parts of it have different dates of origin. These appear in the literature as different ""foundation dates."" More accurately the original foundation date remains unknown, while the others are only rebuilding dates.

The oldest identifiable structure is the northern nave of the church in the inner courtyard, which has two. The northern once stood alone before any fortifications had been built. It is and perhaps originally was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Cape. The frescoes on its walls are as early as the 14th century. This is the only solid evidence of its earliest known date.[4] The evidence dates to a century well within the period of Venetian sovereignty over Crete. The Venetians, however, were of the Roman brand of Christianity, whereas the monks were Greek Orthodox. Not enough is known to be able to extend the date back into times when the Orthodox were ascendant.";

The church then became Lutheran, while the town took over the monastery buildings. In 1724, as part of the Counter-Reformation led by the Holy Roman Empire, the Franciscans regained the church. By 1788, it was a Catholic parish church. During the 18th century, Baroque features were added. The ceiling was replaced around 1772 and stairs were built into the western facade. The choir was heightened and given windows, as well as a Baroque altar dedicated to the Holy Trinity. A Baroque cornice was placed all along the facades. A triangular pediment was added to the western facade, as well as a bulb-shaped belfry. The sundial dates to the same period. Other repairs date to 1847, when the first western portico was likely built.[1] The earliest mention of Franciscans in the town dates to 1268, when the area was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Around that time, the order built a church and monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The choir was begun in the mid-13th century, while the western facade was finished last, around 1270. Around 1444, the damage caused by attacks in 1438 during the Ottoman–Hungarian wars was repaired. Around 1520, the wooden ceiling was replaced by a Gothic vault. The current buttresses were built to support the vault. Several years later, the transition from Gothic to Renaissance was in motion, as seen from stones surviving into the 20th century. In the same period, the church was painted in fresco, fragments of which also lasted until the 20th century. Among the figures depicted were Saint George, the Archangel Michael, Saint Emeric of Hungary, Saint Ladislaus and presumably a donor.;

The monastery was built between the years 985 and 990 by 7 Benedictine monks under the leadership of Leo the Elder, who was invited to build the monastic community by the Georgian Orthodox at the Iviron Monastery.[5] The earliest Benedictine monastics associated with Amalfinon were close friends with Saint Athanasius of Athos, the founder of the Great Lavra.[6] By the 12th century the Amalfinon Monastery, remaining loyal to Eastern Orthodoxy,[7][8] flourished and was held in high esteem. Records on Mount Athos show that the Abbot of Amalfinon signed, in Latin, under the signature of the Abbot of the Great Lavra.

The monastery was peacefully transferred to the Great Lavra in 1287 after suffering greatly from crusaders and being unable to repair the monastery buildings and replace monastics and clergy.[9][10] The Holy Monastery of Amalfinon was turned over by Byzantine emperor Adronikos II Palaiologos to the hands of the Great Lavra Monastery.[11]

The area surrounding the site, now called Morfonos or Amalfinos, as well as the ruins themselves, owe their names to the Monastery of Amalfinon, which was also called Morfonos.[11] There are 5 monks of the Great Lavra tending the land around the area of Morfonos.

In 1574, the Patriarch of Alexandria, Sylvester, helped and the monastery operated again under cenobitic monasticism, but soon the peculiar monasticism was again introduced. In 1655, the Patriarch Dionysios III, who also became a monk, donated his personal fortune for the return to the cenobitic life but again these attempts were insufficient and the peculiar monasticism remained until the 20th century (1914), when there were new attempts for the return to the cenobitic life but without results.

Lakkoskiti belongs to Agiou Pavlou (Greek: Αγίου Παύλου, English: Saint Paul) Monastery. Spiritually, through its mother monastery, and like all the Athos peninsula, it is under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

History
Very little is known about the history of Romanian Lakkoskiti. Monks were living there since the 10th century, belonging to the old Amalfinon Monastery which was soon abandoned and ruined, after the Schism between Eastern Orthodox and Western Roman Catholic Church in 1054 AD. In the 14th century some Serbs borrowed money from Vatopediou Monastery to revive the place but failed to pay it back. So later Vatopediou Monastery, after a deal with Agiou Pavlou Monastery, exchanged the land with other properties. Inscriptions of 1606 AD show that there were Slavs living there while in 1754 the monks are documented as Moldavians (from the Principality of Moldavia, one of the two predecessors of modern Romania). In 1760, Moldavian monk Daniel from Neamț Monastery organized it as Skete.[1]

After the Greek Revolution of 1821 Moldavians and Wallachians (from the Principality of Wallachia, the other predecessors of modern Romania which eventually united with Moldavia) stopped coming to Greece, as the situation was dangerous, while older monks returned home or died. Later new monks started coming again and Lakkoskiti received up to 90 monks in 24 huts. A new wider Kyriako (central church) of Saint Demetrios was built on the expenses of monk Ioustinos, along with a second church at the cemetery and a water-mill. Although receiving ongoing financial assistance from their governments, the Moldavian and Wallachian monks managed to live in peace and harmony without causing any political or ethnic unrest.";
Lesnovo Monastery;Macedonian Orthodox;St MichaelSt Gabriel of Lesnovo;Saint Michael Archangel;1350;2025;675;Ottoman rule;North Macedonia;MKD;Lesnovo, Sofia Province;42,64309;23,640222;Female;;;;personal research NY;;"Jovan Oliver. Lesnovo Monastery (Лесновски манастир) and its significance for the Orthodox Church in that region during medieval times. Today, it is part of the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric, but its medieval history is closely tied to the historical political and ecclesiastical structures of the time, often involving Serbian rule.

Here's what was notable about Lesnovo Monastery during the medieval period:

Location: It's situated in a secluded mountain area near the town of Kratovo in eastern North Macedonia. Its remote location made it suitable for ascetic life.

Foundation and Early Monasticism (11th Century):

The monastery's origins are linked to Saint Gabriel of Lesnovo (Gavrilo Lesnovski), one of the three prominent hermits of the region (along with Prohor of Pčinja and Jovan of Rila). He lived an ascetic life in a cave there in the 11th century.
This early phase established it as a place of hermitage and spiritual devotion. A small church or monastic dwelling likely existed then.
Peak Medieval Period (14th Century): This is when Lesnovo Monastery reached its zenith.

Patronage of Jovan Oliver Grachievich: The most significant period of construction and artistic flourishing occurred in the mid-14th century under the patronage of Jovan Oliver Grachievich, a powerful Serbian magnate (feudal lord) serving under Serbian rulers, including Tsar Stefan Dušan. Oliver's support transformed the site.
Construction of the Main Church: The current main church, dedicated to Archangel Michael (and also venerating St. Gabriel of Lesnovo), was built by Oliver starting around 1341. This is a large and architecturally significant medieval church.
Rich Frescoes: The church is particularly renowned for its exceptionally well-preserved and high-quality frescoes, painted around the same time (1340s and later 14th century). These frescoes represent one of the finest examples of Paleologan style painting in the Balkans, showcasing vibrant colors, complex compositions, and expressive figures. They depict a wide range of biblical scenes, lives of saints, and portraits of donors like Oliver himself.
Role as a Spiritual, Cultural, and Literary Center:

Monastic Community: Under Oliver's patronage, a large and organized monastic community was established and thrived.
Scriptorium: Lesnovo became a very important literary center and scriptorium. Monks here were actively involved in copying, illuminating, and producing manuscripts. The Lesnovo Paranesis (Лесновски паренесис), a significant medieval Slavic manuscript collection from the 14th century, is a key example of its literary output. This activity made it crucial for preserving and disseminating Orthodox literature and culture in the region.
Pilgrimage Site: With the veneration of St. Gabriel of Lesnovo and the beautiful church, it became a significant pilgrimage destination.
Historical Context: During the 14th century, the area was part of the powerful Serbian Empire. The monastery was structurally linked to the Serbian Orthodox Church hierarchy of the time, reflecting the political reality. However, the monastic life and cultural production were also deeply rooted in the local Slavic (Macedonian) context.

In summary, during medieval times, particularly in the 14th century, Lesnovo Monastery, originally founded by the hermit St. Gabriel, transformed under the patronage of Jovan Oliver Grachievich into a major spiritual, artistic, and literary hub. It was celebrated for its impressive medieval architecture, its magnificent frescoes, and its prolific scriptorium, making it one of the most important monastic centers in the Balkans of that era, strongly tied to the Serbian state and church while preserving local cultural identity.";

This led to two attacks from successive bishops with Bishop Adrian causing damage to the walls and Bishop William burning the papers proving this papal exemption and throwing royal privilege papers confirming it into the Someș river. In response to the loss of documentation, King Andrew II of Hungary requested the Pope renew the privileges, which the Pope did and also granted the abbott the right to wear a bishop's mitre and ring.[2]

In the 16th century, it was transferred to the Jesuits. The Calvaria church suffered numerous attacks throughout its existence, with the final one coming in 1661 where it was mostly destroyed by the Tatars except for the choir loft. From there it was mostly used as a military arsenal until 1896 when the Romanian Greek Catholic Church rebuilt the nave.[3] The Greek Catholic Church subsequently rented the church for their sole worship in exchange for a token 1 Romanian leu in rent.[4] In 1948, the communist authorities of the Socialist Republic of Romania confiscated the church and gave it to the Romanian Orthodox Church.[4] Following the Romanian revolution, between 1991 and 1994, it was shared by both Orthodox and Catholics before being returned to sole Catholic use in 1994 with the Catholics restoring it the next year.[4]";

Regarding its status and activities in medieval times:

Traditional Founding: Like many Serbian monasteries whose exact origins are lost to history, there is a tradition that links Lapušnja's founding to the late medieval period, sometimes suggesting the 14th century or the time of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović.
Lack of Concrete Medieval Evidence: However, the surviving church structure and its architecture definitively date from the mid-16th century (specifically 1551-1552). There is little to no material evidence at the site that proves a significant monastic complex existed there during the independent medieval Serbian state in a manner comparable to monasteries like Studenica, Žiča, Gračanica, Ravanica, or Ljubostinja.
Historical Significance (Post-Medieval): Lapušnja is actually very significant for the period under Ottoman rule. The church built in the mid-16th century is remarkably large and richly decorated for that difficult era, suggesting continued vitality and support for the Serbian Orthodox Church even after the fall of the state. Its history is well-documented from that point onwards.
Regarding Activities in Medieval Times:

Since there is limited or no concrete historical or archaeological evidence confirming a significant monastic presence at Lapušnja during the medieval Serbian state period, any discussion of specific medieval activities is speculative.

Possible Small Presence: If a small religious site or hermitage existed there in the 14th or early 15th century, its activities would have been those of a modest monastic community: focused on prayer, asceticism, and perhaps minimal interaction with any nearby small settlements.
Not a Major Center: It was not a royal foundation, the seat of a bishopric, or a major cultural/political hub during the medieval period based on current historical understanding.
Conclusion:

While tradition mentions a medieval origin, Lapušnja Monastery is primarily known for its important church built in the mid-16th century, during the period of Ottoman rule. It is not generally counted among the prominent or well-documented Serbian Orthodox monasteries whose history and activities are centered in the medieval era of the independent Serbian state. Its significance and documented activities belong mainly to the post-medieval period.";

1796-1807 Under Prussian rule; library transferred to Königsberg (now dispersed).  
1807-1839 In the Russian “Białystok Oblast”; still Basilian but closely watched by Orthodox Synod.  
1839 Imperial decree abolishes the Union in Chełm & Podlasie → Supraśl becomes Orthodox again, turned into a “lavra” directly subject to the Synod of St Petersburg.  
1915 Front line of WW I; monks evacuate to Russia, buildings badly damaged.  
1919-1939 Second Polish Republic hands the empty monastery to the Catholic Salesians; Orthodox presence reduced to parish level.  
1944 Retreating German army blows up the Annunciation church (detonated ammunition store).  
1945-1989 Complex used partly by the state forestry school; gradual return of individual buildings to the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church (PAKP).  
1990 Monastic community re-established; since 1993 Supraśl is the seat of the Orthodox diocese of Białystok-Gdańsk.  
2012 Consecration of the rebuilt Annunciation church; community today numbers c. 20 monks.

The Kraków Norbertines, known for centuries as the ""Demoiselles de Zwierzyniec"", led their monastic life in a large fortified complex. This order, one of the oldest in Poland, settled on the banks of the Vistula River more than 850 years ago.

Tradition attributes the creation of the convent, together with the church of St. Augustine and St. John the Baptist, to the noble Crusader knight Jaksa Gryfita. It was around 1150, on his return from the Holy Land, that he is said to have brought the Norbertines from the Czech Republic. The convent welcomed young noble girls and was often run by superiors from princely families. The young ladies of Zwierzyniec owned and managed many properties. Their monastery – thanks to its strategic location – was of great importance for the defense of Kraków. The history of this large fortified convent is strongly marked by invasions and sieges, starting with the Tatar invasions of the thirteenth century. It is to these aggressors that the beautiful legend of the Lajkonik is linked. It gave birth to the traditional parade that leaves every year from the courtyard of the monastery one week after Corpus Christi. Other, much darker legends tell of the flight of the sisters who sought refuge in the church of Saint-Sauveur, among the rocks of the nearby forests. One of the Norbertines, venerated as Blessed Bronisława, then settled in a hermitage on a hill that now bears her name. Another legend relates that the Tatars took down and drowned the bell of the monastery in the Vistula. The latter sounds in a funereal tone, invoking a prayer for those drowned in the waters surrounding the convent. Once a year, around St. John's Day, it rises to the surface to ring until midnight. The oldest remains of the church – including the Romanesque portal at the entrance to the tower – date from the thirteenth century. A large part of the walls and defence towers date from the fifteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Superior Dorota Kątska undertook a redesign of the entire complex in Baroque style. The work was directed for many years by renowned Italian builders, including the royal architect Giovanni Trevano. The current decoration of the church, however, dates from the eighteenth century – because the Norbertines had to face another invasion, this time from Sweden. To the destruction of the siege was added a terrible fire.

Every year, on Easter Monday, a large fair, called Emaus, is held around the monastery. You can buy figurines of Jewish musicians (specially carved for this occasion) and heart-shaped gingerbread.";

In 1530, it was assigned together with Malta to the Knights of St. John, who had been expelled by the Ottoman Turks from their stronghold on the island of Rhodes.[9] Finding themselves in hostile territory, the Knights reinforced the city walls and built defenses. Though built on top of older buildings (possibly including a Roman public bath), much of the earliest defensive structures of the Tripoli castle (or ""Assaraya al-Hamra"", i.e., the ""Red Castle"") are attributed to the Knights of St John.

Having previously combated piracy from their base on Rhodes, the Knights were given charge of the city to prevent it from being retaken by Barbary pirates. The disruption the pirates caused to the Christian shipping lanes in the Mediterranean had been one of the main incentives for the Spanish conquest of the city.


Tripoli, 1675, map by John Seller
The knights held the city until the Siege of Tripoli in 1551 and their surrender to the Ottomans, led by the Muslim Turkish commander Turgut Reis.[10] Turgut Reis served as pasha of Tripoli. During his rule, he adorned and built up the city, making it one of the most impressive cities along the North African Coast.[11] Turgut was buried in Tripoli after his death in 1565. His body was taken from Malta, where he had fallen during the Ottoman siege of the island, to a tomb in the Sidi Darghut Mosque which he had established close to his palace in Tripoli. The palace has since disappeared (supposedly it was situated between the so-called ""Ottoman prison"" and the Arch of Marcus Aurelius), but the mosque, along with his tomb, still stands, close to the Bab Al-Bahr gate.

After the capture by the Ottoman Turks, Tripoli once again became a base of operation for Barbary pirates. One of several Western attempts to dislodge them again was a Royal Navy attack under John Narborough in 1675, of which a vivid eye-witness account has survived.[12]

Zaraka Monastery;Cistercian;;Saint Mary;1225;1276;51;Abandoned;Greece;GRC ;Sikyona;37,9156;22,5330;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Zaraka Monastery is a ruined Frankish abbey near Stymfalia, in the Peloponnese, in Greece. It was built about a kilometre from the shores of Lake Stymphalia, the site of the ancient city of Stymphalus, during the ""Frankokratia"", i.e. the occupation of parts of the Byzantine Empire by Franks and Venetians, following the events of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the establishment of the Latin Empire of Constantinople and Greece. The monastery was built by monks of the Cistercian Order, in c. 1225. What is particularly noteworthy about this monastery is that it the only one actually built by the Cistercians in Greece (out of the approx. 17-19 houses throughout Greece), since in all other occasion the Cistercians had occupied existing Greek Orthodox monasteries that had been abandoned by the Greek monks.

In this respect it is one of the exceptionally few samples of western Gothic architecture in Greece, along with the (most likely Benedictine) monastery of Isova in the western Peloponnese (just north of the village of Trypiti). It was initially excavated by Professor Anastasios Orlandos in the 1920s and then by E. Stikas in the 1960s before a joint project by the Canadian Institute at Athens and the Archaeological Society of Athens prepared the first detailed state plan of the church in 1984. Excavations from 1993 to 1996 by the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto uncovered areas around the gate house and the cloister.

Some scholars believe that the abbey had been built in the same location, or general area as an ancient Greek temple dedicated to Artemis, which is supported by the fact that materials from a temple have been extensively used in the buildings of the monastery; it is possible, however, that these elements (reused column drums, for example) came from the ancient city a few hundred metres away.

The monastery makes sporadic appearance in the Statutes of the Cistercian General Chapter and it was one of the houses granted special exemption from the compulsory annual attendance at the General Chapter, and along with the houses in Syria and the Crusader States it was only required to attend once every seven years. The monastery was abandoned in 1276.

The main surviving structures are the imposing vaulted gate house and the church, especially its western end as well as parts of the defensive wall around the monastery. Excavation to the NE of the east end of the church (possibly a narthex was originally planned but never completed) revealed an arched entrance probably to the refectory which had fallen in an earthquake. The PIMS excavations demonstrated that the abbey was resettled in the late 14th century and inhabited perhaps intermittently until the mid 16th century. A number of graves from this later reoccupation were excavated in and around the cloister, including a headless man and one with a German banker's token of the mid 16th century.";

Regarding its status and activities in medieval times:

Traditional Founding: Traditions often place the origin of Holy Trinity Monastery in Gornja Kamenica in the late medieval period, sometimes linking it to the era of the Serbian Despotate in the late 14th or early 15th century.
Lack of Concrete Medieval Evidence: However, unlike monasteries with substantial surviving medieval architecture and documentation (like those of the Raška or Morava schools), there is very little preserved material evidence at the site that definitively dates back to the medieval period. The current church and monastic complex are largely the result of rebuilding and renovations in later centuries, particularly during the Ottoman period and afterwards.
Historical Focus: The monastery's documented history and importance primarily lie in the post-medieval era, especially the 16th-18th centuries. It was active during this time, often destroyed and rebuilt, serving as a center of local spiritual life and a symbol of Orthodox resilience under Ottoman rule.
Regarding Activities in Medieval Times:

Because there is limited evidence confirming its significant existence and activities during the medieval Serbian state period, discussing specific activities is largely speculative.

Possible Small Presence: If a monastic community did exist there in the late 14th or early 15th century, it would likely have been a small, local foundation, perhaps a hermitage or a small church with a few monks.
Activities (if it existed): Their activities would have centered on the basic monastic life: prayer, ascetic practice, and perhaps serving the immediate spiritual needs of any nearby small settlements. It would not have been a major center of art, literacy, or political influence in the way that royal or large diocesan monasteries were.
Conclusion:

While tradition suggests a possible late medieval origin for Holy Trinity Monastery in Gornja Kamenica, it is not considered a prominent or well-documented medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery based on surviving evidence. Its historical significance and preserved structures belong more clearly to the centuries after the fall of the medieval Serbian state. Therefore, detailing specific medieval activities for this monastery is not possible with historical certainty.";

Regarding its status and activities in medieval times:

Traditional Founding: Tradition links the founding of Divljana Monastery to the 13th century, often associating it with Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church. If true, this would place its origin firmly within the height of the medieval Serbian state under the Nemanjić dynasty.
Lack of Concrete Medieval Evidence: However, despite the strong tradition, there is very little preserved architectural material or historical documentation at the site that definitively confirms the existence of a significant monastic complex during the independent medieval Serbian state (13th-15th centuries). The current monastery church, dedicated to Saint Demetrius, was built in the 19th century on the foundations of previous churches. Archaeological research has uncovered older layers, suggesting earlier structures, but conclusively linking them to a prominent medieval monastic foundation of the 13th century with detailed activities is difficult based on current evidence.
Historical Focus (Post-Medieval): The monastery's documented history and significance primarily lie in the post-medieval period, particularly during centuries of Ottoman rule. It was active as a local spiritual center, often suffering destruction and being rebuilt, serving as a symbol of resilience and a focal point for local Orthodox life.
Regarding Activities in Medieval Times:

Given the limited concrete evidence for a substantial medieval foundation at Divljana:

Possible Smaller Presence: If a monastic community existed there in the medieval period, it would likely have been a smaller foundation, perhaps a hermitage or a small church with a few monks, rather than a large, well-endowed monastery like those founded by the Nemanjić rulers or high nobility.
Activities (if it existed): Their activities would have been centered on the basic monastic life:
Prayer and ascetic practice.
Performing religious services for the small community.
Perhaps serving any sparse local population.
Self-sustenance through limited agriculture or resources.
Not a Major Center: Divljana is not mentioned in the key medieval sources listing major Serbian monasteries, bishoprics, or significant cultural/political centers of the time.
Conclusion:

While tradition strongly links Divljana Monastery to the medieval period (possibly the 13th century), there is no significant surviving medieval architecture or strong historical documentation to confirm its status as a prominent or well-established Serbian Orthodox monastery with extensive activities during that era. Its documented importance and preserved structures belong mainly to the centuries following the fall of the medieval Serbian state. Therefore, discussing specific medieval activities for Divljana beyond the general life of a small monastic community is highly speculative based on existing historical and archaeological knowledge.";
St John the Baptist Monastery (Jašunja);Serbian Orthodox;Saint John the Baptist;Saint John the Baptist;1517;2025;508;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Jašunja;43,0669;22,0192;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Andronic Cantakouzin ; ÐœÐ°Ð½Ð°ÑÑ‚Ð¸Ñ€ â€“ Ð¡Ð²ÐµÑ‚Ð¾Ð³ ÐˆÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð° ÐšÑ€ÑÑ‚Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÑ™Ð° Ñƒ ÐˆÐ°ÑˆÑƒÑšÐ¸ St. John the Baptist Monastery (Manastir Sv. Jovana Preteče) located near Jašunja (not far from Leskovac) in southern Serbia.

This is a significant Serbian Orthodox monastery with a clear connection to the medieval period. Note that there are two medieval monasteries in the Jašunja area; the other is the Monastery of St. Nicholas. We'll focus on St. John the Baptist as you requested.

Here's a breakdown of its status and activities in medieval times:

Location: Situated near the village of Jašunja, south of Leskovac, in a region that was part of the medieval Serbian state and later the Serbian Despotate.
Period: It was founded in the early 15th century, placing it firmly within the era of the Serbian Despotate, specifically during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarević.
Founder (Ktitor): This is crucial – the monastery was founded by Despot Stefan Lazarević himself. This makes it a royal foundation, directly linked to the highest level of the Serbian state.
Architectural Style: The church of St. John the Baptist is a single-nave church with a dome. While simpler in plan than the trefoil churches typical of the main Morava school further north (like Ravanica or Ljubostinja), its construction dates to the same period and shares stylistic elements, representing a variant or early form of the Morava school in the southern part of the Despotate. It was built using stone and brick.
Historical Significance: As a direct foundation of Despot Stefan Lazarević, the monastery held high status. It was a symbol of the Despot's piety, his patronage of the Church, and his presence in this part of his realm. It was intended to serve as a spiritual center and potentially a burial place or memorial for someone of importance (though not the Despot himself).
Current State: The medieval church has survived, though it has undergone repairs and conservation over the centuries. Parts of the original medieval frescoes are preserved inside, although much has been lost.
Activities in medieval times:

Given its status as a royal foundation in the early 15th century:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The core function was the monastic life – a community of monks dedicated to prayer, asceticism, and the regular performance of Orthodox divine services within the monastery church.
Cultural and Artistic Hub:
Fresco Painting: As a royal foundation, the church was intended to be richly decorated with frescoes. The preserved fragments attest to this. The creation and maintenance of these paintings were major activities, involving skilled artists (zoographers) of the time.
Scriptorium: Monasteries, especially those patronized by rulers, typically had a scriptorium where religious texts, liturgical books, and other important manuscripts were copied and sometimes illuminated. This would have been a likely activity.
Repository of Knowledge: The monastery would have housed valuable religious books, possibly charters related to its foundation and endowments, and other important documents.
Economic Unit: Endowed by Despot Stefan Lazarević, the monastery would have managed land and other resources provided for its sustenance and the support of the monastic community.
Social and Political Connection: As a foundation of the ruler, the monastery had social standing and served as a spiritual focal point linked to the state and its elite. It would have served the spiritual needs of any nearby population and likely received visits from the Despot or his representatives.
In summary, St. John the Baptist Monastery in Jašunja was a genuine and significant medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery, a direct foundation of Despot Stefan Lazarević from the early 15th century. While perhaps not as large or architecturally complex as some of the major Morava school monasteries further north, it was an important spiritual and cultural center linked to the Serbian state and its ruler, dedicated to monastic life, art (fresco painting), and the preservation of religious texts.";

The Church of Saint Mercurius served as the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria between 1300 and 1500 AD and is perhaps the only one in Cairo with its original foundation intact. It stands 31.5 meters long by 21 meters wide.

Many Coptic patriarchs resided in the church during the 11th through the 15th centuries, and later during the 16 and 18th centuries, others were consecrated in the Church of St. Mercurius. The church also came to be the final resting place for many church leaders.[2]";

The church of Notre Dame at Isova, built in the first half of the 13th century, is among the best surviving examples of Gothic architecture in the Peloponnese, along with the church of Saint Sophia at Andravida and the monastery of Zaraka at Stymphalia. The Frankish monastery at Isova was founded some time after 1205, when the French Principality of Achaea was created in southern Greece in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, and before 1263, when the abbey was destroyed by fire (see below). Although the religious order responsible for the monastery is not recorded, it is now generally believed to have been a Cistercian foundation.[1] The Cistercians were active in the Fourth Crusade and established at least a dozen abbeys in Byzantine territories captured by the Crusaders,[2] and there is archival evidence that specifically suggests Cistercian involvement in two monastic foundations in the Peloponnese itself during the early 13th century.[3] One of these two Cistercian abbeys in the Peloponnese can be identified with certainty as the monastery of Zaraka at Stymphalia, in the archdiocese of Corinth.[4] For the other, the monastery at Isova, in the archdiocese of Patras, appears to be the only known candidate. Notre Dame
The abbey church of Notre Dame consisted of single large rectangular hall, ca. 38.5 m long by 12.5 m wide (internal measurements), with a chancel at the eastern end projecting an additional ca. 8 m and ending in an octagonal apse supported by six external buttresses.[5] The west and north walls are nearly intact; the south wall is partially destroyed and the east end is barely preserved above the foundations. There is no evidence of internal supports dividing the interior into nave and aisles, and no narthex or transept. The triangular gable of the west wall preserves the profile of the steeply pitched wooden roof, which apparently covered the entire width of the main hall in a single span, presumably with trusses, which were supported on simple corbels ca. 4 m apart in the side walls. A reused fragment of rib vaulting built into the wall of the later church of Saint Nicolas suggests that the chancel was roofed with a stone vault.[6] The well-preserved windows in the north wall are single lancets (1.80 m high) topped by ogival arches. The west wall had two slightly larger windows (2.40 m high) below and a single much larger one (3.60 m high) in the gable. A small fragment of stone tracery found nearby may indicate that the windows in the chancel were larger and more elaborate, with two lights surmounted by a cinquefoil.[7] Traces of abutting walls and supports for floor and roof beams in the exterior north wall of the church show that the cloister and other monastery buildings were located on that side, although no remains of these are visible today.[8] In plan, architectural style, and construction technique the church belongs entirely to the western European Gothic tradition, without any sign of Byzantine influence, and it has been suggested that it was not merely designed but actually built by western craftsmen, if not by the monks themselves.[9]

According to the 14th-century Chronicle of the Morea, the church was destroyed by fire in 1263, shortly before the battle of Prinitza, by a band of Turkish mercenaries fighting alongside Greek forces in an attempt to restore Byzantine control over the Peloponnese.[10]";

Donor
An inscription above the western entrance of the church mentions Stefan Uroš II. Milutin (1253-1321) as its donor.[3] His building conversions and donations are also confirmed by archbishop and biographer Danilo II.[4] The donor portrait on the northern wall shows Milutin next to the patron saint George and is characterized by the symbolic exchange of gifts: the emperor presents a model of the church, while George hands over a sword for Milutin's military services. The latter is also addressed in the inscription which refers to the victory over the Turks and therefore gives a hint about the edification of the church in the year 1312/13.[5]";

The monastery bears the name of Serbian Prince Marko, who reigned at the time of its completion in the 14th century.[1][2] Marko's Monastery has been active since its establishment.[3]

Description
Marko's Monastery contains a single cross-shaped church dedicated to Saint Demetrius. The monastery grounds also consist of lodgings, a belfry, a well, warehouses, a bakery, and a mill.[4] The monastery still operates a special oven used to make rakija.[5]


Fresco depicting Saint Demetrius
The church has a narthex, a central dome and a smaller dome on the western side.[1] It was built of bricks and stone. The iconstasis is made of stone pillars.[4]

The frescoes inside the church were done by a number of painters from the region.[1] The Holy Mother of God, the twelve great feasts, Jesus Christ, and Saint Nicholas are some of the subjects depicted in the frescoes.[4]

History

Fresco depicting King Marko
Construction of the Church of Saint Demetrius began under King Vukašin in 1346.[2] The church, including the interior paintings, were completed 30 years later. Before Ottoman rule, the monastery had a school and many monks and priests would write manuscripts.[5]

In 1392, Skopje fell under Ottoman rule, which led to the destruction of many churches and monasteries in the area. Marko's Monastery, however, suffered almost no damage.[4] During the Ottoman era, in 1467/8 the monastery is recorded as having 20 monks.[3] Kiril Peychinovich was the hegumen of Marko's Monastery from 1801 to 1818.[6]

In 1830, Ottoman aristocrat Hamzi Paşa added an exonarthex to the church.[3]

Frescoes showing the ktetor King Vukašin and his son Prince Marko were the most defaced by overpainting with a fat-based paint in 1894, an act of national fanaticism ordered by the Bulgarian metropolitan of Skopje. In the 1920s, attempts were made to restore the damaged frescoes.[7]";

The most common traditions link Nimnik to either the time of Saint Sava (early 13th century) or the time of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović (late 14th century). Either of these would place its origin within the medieval Serbian state.
Lack of Concrete Medieval Evidence: However, despite the tradition, there is very little preserved architectural material or reliable historical documentation at the site that definitively proves the existence of a significant monastic complex during the height of the independent medieval Serbian state (13th-15th centuries). The current monastery church is largely from later periods, notably the 17th and 18th centuries, reflecting rebuildings after destruction.
Legendary Origin: The monastery's name is associated with a local legend about a boy (""Nimnik"") who was martyred, but this is folklore and doesn't provide a historical date or founder for the monastery itself.
Historical Focus (Post-Medieval): The monastery's history is better documented from the 17th century onwards, particularly during periods of Austrian and Ottoman rule, when it played a role in preserving Serbian Orthodox life and culture.
Regarding Activities in Medieval Times:

Given the lack of concrete evidence for a substantial medieval foundation at Nimnik:

Possible Small Presence: If a monastic community existed there in the medieval period, it would likely have been a small, possibly hermitage-type settlement, perhaps a small church or dwelling for a few monks.
Activities (if it existed): Their activities would have been centered on basic monastic life: prayer, ascetic practice, and self-sustenance. It would not have been a major center of art, literature, or political influence in the way that the large royal foundations were.
Not a Prominent Center: Nimnik is not mentioned in the medieval sources that list major monasteries, bishoprics, or cultural centers of the time.
Conclusion:

While tradition links Nimnik Monastery to the medieval period (either the 13th or 14th century), there is no significant surviving medieval architecture or strong historical documentation to confirm its status as a prominent or well-established Serbian Orthodox monastery during that era. Its documented history and activities largely belong to the centuries following the fall of the medieval Serbian state. Therefore, discussing specific medieval activities for Nimnik is highly speculative based on existing historical and archaeological knowledge.";

Fresco painting of this monastery is pretty valuable and that is why this monastery was put on the list of important cultural monuments. The best preserved are parts of the frescoes in the parvis which represent a ktetorial composition. Krepičevac monastery has a built iconostasis with several icons preserved – Christ, holy mother of God, St. John, Annunciation. Krepičevac is a female monastery.
History
The founder is considered to be prefect Georgije, son of Jan, who holds the model of the church on the foundation composition, next to him is his wife Zora, and next to her is her son Manojlo. Georgi is considered to be the grandson of Radul Bey (1499–1508). The time of construction is related to the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century. Historical records about this monastery are rare. He is mentioned as active in 1761 and 1780. In the 19th century, M. Đ. Milićević mentions a painting inside the church from 1761, and that under it you can see frescoes from an unknown era. No long period of time passed between the construction of Krepičevac and the nearby Lapušnja Monastery, and it is assumed that both monasteries had the same founders.[2]

At the beginning of the 19th century, Hajduk Veljko together with Prince Milisav appointed Hieromonk Akaki from Sveta Gora as the head of the monastery, who in 1809 became the abbot of the monastery, as evidenced by an entry in a liturgical book. Together with the monastery in Grliste, it belongs to the most persistent places in the fight against the Turks during the days of the First Serbian uprising. Six nuns and seven novices from the Kuveždin Monastery were moved to this abandoned monastery in the Eparchy of Timok in 1930. The nun, and later abbess of the monastery Angelina Ličanin (worldly known as Vidosava), who sold her two houses near the Palace Albanija in Belgrade to rebuild the monastery and used the money to build a dormitory for the sisters, was buried in the monastery gate in 1969.[3]

It was originally a Roman Catholic (Benedictine) monastery, built before 1177 and destroyed before 1293. The present monastery, which belongs to the Romanian Orthodox Church, was built near the ruins of the first monastery in the late 14th or early 15th century. Location: Hodoș-Bodrog is located in the Arad County region of Romania, which was part of the Kingdom of Hungary during this period. This area, in the Pannonian Basin, was directly in the path of the Mongol invasions.
Mongol Invasion (1241-1242): The Mongols (often referred to as Tatars in European sources of the time) inflicted catastrophic devastation on the Kingdom of Hungary. Monasteries, often being centers of some wealth and settlement, were prime targets for destruction and plunder. Many were wiped out.
Aftermath and Continued Instability: Even if Hodoș-Bodrog survived the initial 1241-1242 invasion, the aftermath was one of severe depopulation, economic collapse, and ongoing insecurity. The region remained vulnerable to further raids by Golden Horde successor groups or other nomadic peoples like the Cumans (who were sometimes allied with, and sometimes enemies of, the Hungarians).
Royal Authority and Reconstruction: King Béla IV of Hungary undertook massive efforts to rebuild the kingdom after the Mongol withdrawal, including building stone castles and encouraging resettlement. However, smaller or more exposed monastic communities might not have had the resources or royal priority to be re-established or might have simply ceased to exist due to loss of community and endowments.
The Date 1293: While some 50 years after the main Mongol invasion, the ""termination"" date could reflect:
A final, definitive abandonment of a site that had struggled since the invasions.
A formal declaration of suppression for a monastery that was no longer viable.
Destruction during a later, significant raid by Tatars or Cumans which were still active in the region throughout the late 13th century. The end of the Árpád dynasty in Hungary (1301) also ushered in a period of interregnum and increased internal conflict, which could have impacted vulnerable institutions.";

Drenča Monastery;Serbian Orthodox;Presentation of Mary;Saint Michael Archangel;1379;2025;646;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Drenča;43,4758;21,055;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Dorotej of Hilandar and Danilo III (patriarch) ; ÐœÐ°Ð½Ð°ÑÑ‚Ð¸Ñ€ - Ð”Ñ€ÐµÐ½Ñ‡Ð°. Drenča Monastery is indeed a significant Serbian Orthodox monastery with roots in the medieval period.

Here's a breakdown:

Location: It is located near the town of Aleksandrovac, in the Župa region of Serbia.
Period: It was founded in the late 14th or early 15th century, placing it firmly within the era of the Serbian Despotate, specifically during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarević.
Founder (Ktitor): The monastery's ktitor (founder and patron) was Veliki Čelnik Radič Postupović, one of the highest-ranking noblemen and military commanders in the service of Despot Stefan Lazarević. This fact is very important as it shows the monastery was a foundation of the highest Serbian aristocracy of the time, directly connected to the ruling court.
Architectural Style: Based on archaeological research of the foundations, the medieval church belonged to the Morava architectural school, characteristic of the late 14th and early 15th centuries. This style includes a trefoil base, a dome, and typically rich exterior decoration (though little of this is preserved from the medieval structure).
Historical Significance: As a foundation of a major figure like Veliki Čelnik Radič, Drenča was a part of the network of monasteries supported by the Serbian elite during a challenging period. It represented the piety and cultural aspirations of the Despotate. It was mentioned in historical documents, indicating its existence and importance in its time.
Current State: The original medieval monastery was destroyed and rebuilt numerous times throughout history, particularly during periods of conflict. The current monastery complex is a modern reconstruction built on the medieval foundations, but archaeological findings confirm the layout and style of the original church.
Activities in medieval times:

Based on its status as a monastic foundation of a high-ranking nobleman in the Despotate:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The primary function was housing a community of monks dedicated to prayer, asceticism, and performing the daily cycle of Orthodox divine services.
Cultural Hub (on a scale appropriate for a noble foundation):
Scriptorium: Monasteries of this type often had a scriptorium for copying religious texts, liturgical books, and possibly chronicles or other important documents.
Fresco Painting: The medieval church would have been adorned with frescoes, following the artistic trends of the Morava school of painting (though these have not survived).
Repository of Knowledge: It would have housed religious books and potentially charters or other documents related to the monastery and its founder.
Economic Unit: Endowed with land and resources by Veliki Čelnik Radič, the monastery would have managed these assets to support the monastic community.
Social and Political Connection: As a foundation of a powerful nobleman, the monastery would have had local social standing and served as a spiritual focal point connected to the elite circles of the Despotate.
In summary, Drenča Monastery was a genuine medieval Serbian Orthodox foundation from the time of the Despotate, patronized by a high-ranking nobleman and built in the characteristic Morava architectural style. Although the original medieval structure is not fully preserved, its historical context and archaeological evidence confirm its existence and importance as a spiritual and cultural center linked to the Serbian elite in the early 15th century.";

Spiritual and Liturgical Center: Their primary function was as places for monastic life, prayer, and celebrating the Divine Liturgy. Monks dedicated their lives to spiritual discipline.
Cultural Hubs: Monasteries were centers of literacy and learning. They housed scriptoria where religious texts, chronicles, and other important documents were copied and illuminated. They preserved knowledge and tradition.
Artistic Centers: Monks and invited masters created significant works of art, including fresco painting, icon painting, manuscript illumination, wood carving, and metalwork. Monasteries like those of the Morava school (even though not in the Lepenac valley itself, represent the era's style) showcase incredible architectural and sculptural achievement.
Economic Units: Monasteries often received large land donations from rulers and nobility. They managed agricultural lands, vineyards, forests, and workshops, making them significant economic entities in their regions.
Social Support: They sometimes provided alms, shelter, and assistance to the poor, travelers, and sick.
Political Influence: As major landowners and cultural centers, monasteries often held significant social and political influence and were closely tied to the ruling dynasty and nobility.
Identity Preservation: In times of political instability or foreign rule, monasteries often became custodians of Serbian national and religious identity.

Ljubostinja important in the context of medieval Serbia:

Location: Located near Trstenik, in the Morava Valley region of Serbia.
Period: It was founded in the late 14th century, specifically after the Battle of Kosovo (1389), placing it firmly in the era of Morava Serbia and the subsequent Serbian Despotate.
Founder: It was founded by Princess Milica, the wife of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, who fell at the Battle of Kosovo.
Significance: A Royal Convent: This is a key feature. After her husband's death, Princess Milica became a nun here (taking the monastic name Eugenia), and it became a convent that gathered many widows of Serbian noblemen who had died fighting the Ottomans. This made it a unique center housing members of the highest medieval Serbian aristocracy.
Architectural Style: Ljubostinja is considered one of the most beautiful and representative examples of the Morava architectural school. Its features include:
A trefoil (cloverleaf) base plan.
Numerous domes (often five).
Extensive and intricate exterior decoration using stone carving (arabesques, geometric patterns, and sometimes figures) and ceramic ornamentation.
Artistic Value: The monastery church (dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God) is famous for its well-preserved frescoes. These frescoes are masterpieces of the Morava school of painting, depicting scenes from the life of Christ, the Mother of God, and various saints, including portraits of Princess Milica and her son, Despot Stefan Lazarević.
Activities in medieval times:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: Like all monasteries, its primary function was as a center for prayer, asceticism, and the celebration of Orthodox divine services. However, as a convent, it focused on the spiritual life of the female monastic community.
Refuge and Community for Noble Widows: Its unique role was providing a spiritual home and community for aristocratic women who had lost their husbands in the wars against the Ottomans. This brought together highly educated and influential women.
Cultural and Artistic Hub:
Scriptorium: It undoubtedly had a scriptorium where religious texts, liturgical books, and perhaps historical chronicles were copied and illuminated by nuns or invited scribes.
Fresco Painting Workshop: The creation of the magnificent frescoes was a major activity, employing the best painters of the time (such as Makarije, whose signature is preserved).
Patronage: As a royal foundation, it attracted patronage and was a center for artistic and cultural endeavors encouraged by Princess Milica and the noblewomen residing there.
Political (Indirect) and Social Influence: As the residence of Princess Milica, who played a significant role in governing with her son Despot Stefan, the monastery had indirect political importance. It was a place associated with the ruling family and likely a focal point for support and loyalty during challenging times. It also served as a burial place for some of the nobility.
Economic Management: Endowed with lands and resources by its founders and patrons, the convent managed its estates to support the community.
In summary, Ljubostinja Monastery was a vital and unique institution in late medieval Serbia, serving not only as a stunning example of the Morava architectural school and a center of high artistic achievement but also as a crucial spiritual and social refuge for the Serbian aristocracy after the trauma of the Battle of Kosovo, directly linked to the ruling family.";

Period: It was built in the mid-14th century, placing it firmly within the late medieval period of the Serbian state, specifically during the time of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, to whom its foundation is traditionally attributed.

Location: It is located near the town of Brus, in the Kopaonik region of Serbia.

Architectural Style: Milentija is considered one of the most representative examples of the Morava architectural school. This style, characteristic of the Serbian Despotate and the period just before the Ottoman conquest, is known for its intricate stone carvings (relief decoration), tripartite churches (shaped like a trefoil or cloverleaf), and domes. Milentija is particularly famous for the richness and detail of its exterior stone sculpture, especially around the windows and portals.

Historical Significance: Like many medieval Serbian monasteries, Milentija served not only as a spiritual center but also as a hub of culture, art, and literacy. It reflected the power, piety, and artistic aspirations of the Serbian rulers and nobility of the time.

Current State: The monastery fell into ruin after the Ottoman conquest and remained so for centuries. Today, the monastery church is largely preserved in ruins, with archaeological work having revealed its layout and many decorative elements. These ruins, however, clearly show the sophisticated architecture and exquisite sculptural decoration it once possessed. There is also a newer church built nearby.

So, Milentija Monastery is a key historical site that provides valuable insight into the architecture, art, and religious life of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the late medieval era, particularly embodying the unique characteristics of the Morava school of architecture. Milentija Monastery.

As we discussed before:

Name: Milentija Monastery
Period: Founded in the mid-14th century (Medieval Serbia, during Prince Lazar's rule).
Location: Near the town of Brus.
Architectural Style: A prime example of the Morava architectural school, characterized by its trefoil base, domes, and exceptionally rich exterior stone carving (reliefs depicting geometric patterns, animals, and sometimes figures).
Current State: The medieval church of Milentija exists today primarily as well-preserved ruins. The foundations and walls up to a certain height, along with significant portions of the decorative stone sculpture, are visible. This allows archaeologists and visitors to appreciate its former grandeur. There is also a newer church built nearby to support modern monastic life.
Activities in medieval times (based on the nature of such monasteries):

While detailed records specific to Milentija's daily activities from the medieval period might be limited due to its ruinous state for centuries, like other significant monasteries of its time, it would have served as:

A spiritual center: A place for monks to live, pray, and perform religious services according to Orthodox tradition.
An artistic workshop: The elaborate carvings show it was a place where skilled stonemasons worked. Monasteries often had scriptoria for copying manuscripts and potentially workshops for other crafts like icon painting or metalwork, although direct evidence for this at Milentija itself from the medieval period is less documented than for larger royal lavras.
A cultural landmark: Its impressive architecture and decoration would have been a testament to the piety, wealth, and artistic sophistication of its founder (traditionally Prince Lazar) and the Serbian state.
Possibly an economic unit: Monasteries were often endowed with land and resources, making them centers of local economic activity.";
Klisura Monastery (Serbia);Serbian Orthodox;Gabriel;Saint Mary;1250;2025;775;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Vrbnica;43,4903;20,9678;Female;;;;personal research NY;;"Klisura Monastery (Манастир Клисура), located near Arilje in western Serbia, and its role within the Serbian Orthodox Church during medieval times.

Klisura is a beautiful monastery situated in a gorge of the Moravica River. While not one of the grandest royal foundations like Studenica or Mileševa, it is a significant medieval site with a long history.

Here's what was notable about Klisura Monastery in the medieval period:

Location: Situated in a strategic yet secluded gorge (""klisura"" means ""gorge"" or ""ravine"") on the Moravica River, near the medieval town and bishopric of Arilje. This location offered both natural defense and proximity to a regional center.

Foundation (Late 13th / Early 14th Century):

The monastery's origins date back to the late 13th or early 14th century.
Tradition links its founding or significant early patronage to members of the Nemanjić dynasty, possibly King Stefan Dragutin or his sons, who ruled this region (Mačva and northern Serbia) during parts of this period.
Dedication: The monastery is dedicated to the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel.

Role as a Monastic Community:

Klisura served as an active monastic community throughout the medieval period. Monks lived here, following Orthodox monastic rules, dedicating their lives to prayer, worship, and spiritual discipline in relative isolation within the gorge.
It was part of the network of monasteries that flourished in medieval Serbia under the Nemanjić rulers, contributing to the spread and strengthening of Orthodoxy.
Medieval Architecture and Art:

The core of the monastery is the church of the Holy Archangels. While it has undergone destruction and restoration over centuries, its foundations and some parts date back to the medieval period. The architectural style would have followed the regional variations of Serbian medieval church building.
Crucially, the church contains medieval frescoes. Although not as extensive or famous as those in major royal foundations, the existence of medieval wall paintings indicates that the monastery was decorated according to the artistic standards of the time, reflecting the theological and artistic trends of the Serbian Church. These surviving fragments are valuable historical and artistic sources.
Connection to Arilje: Its proximity to the important medieval Bishopric of Arilje (which had its own major church, now the Church of St. Achillius, built around the same time) meant that Klisura was part of the broader ecclesiastical landscape of the region and might have been under the direct spiritual oversight of the Bishop of Arilje.

Local Spiritual Center: While not a royal necropolis or a primary academic center like some larger monasteries, Klisura was a vital spiritual center for the local population in the Moravica valley. It provided a place for worship, pilgrimage, and spiritual guidance for the surrounding villages.

Challenges: Like many medieval Serbian monasteries, Klisura faced destruction and periods of decline, particularly during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans starting in the late 14th century.

In summary, during medieval times (primarily from the late 13th/early 14th century onwards), Klisura Monastery near Arilje was an active Serbian Orthodox monastic community founded under probable Nemanjić patronage. Situated in a strategic gorge, it served as a local spiritual center, housed monks practicing asceticism, and featured medieval architecture and decorative frescoes, though it was not a royal necropolis or a major scriptorium on the scale of the largest Serbian medieval monasteries. It played a role in preserving faith and culture in its region before facing the challenges of the Ottoman era.";

Kumanica is a monastery located in a visually striking position in a gorge. Its medieval history is less fully documented than some of the major royal foundations, but it was an active monastic site during that era.

Here's what's known and believed about Kumanica in the medieval period:

Location: It is situated in the picturesque gorge of the Lim River, in southwestern Serbia, near the border with Montenegro. Its location in a rugged, somewhat isolated gorge is typical for medieval monastic foundations seeking solitude.

Foundation (Medieval Period):

The monastery's exact founding date and founder are not precisely known from definitive medieval sources.
However, based on architectural analysis and stylistic similarities to other churches in the region, its origins are generally placed in the late 13th or 14th century. This puts it firmly within the period of the flourishing medieval Serbian state under the Nemanjić dynasty.
Traditions often associate it with founders from the Nemanjić era, but specific historical documents are scarce for this earliest phase.
Dedication: The monastery is dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel.

Role as a Monastic Community:

During medieval times, Kumanica was an active Serbian Orthodox monastic community. Monks lived here, dedicated to prayer, worship, and asceticism in the relative isolation of the gorge.
It was part of the broader network of monasteries established throughout the Serbian lands during the Nemanjić period, which played a crucial role in consolidating Orthodoxy and Serbian identity.
Medieval Architecture and Art:

The current church structure largely reflects later renovations, but its foundations and certain architectural elements date back to the medieval period (13th/14th century). The style would have been representative of regional Serbian medieval church architecture, influenced by Byzantine models.
Evidence suggests the church was originally adorned with medieval frescoes. While much has been lost over centuries of damage and abandonment, remnants or stylistic cues indicate that artistic decoration was part of its medieval form, reflecting the religious iconography and artistic trends of the time.
Local/Regional Significance:

While not a major royal necropolis or a large academic center like Studenica or Mileševa, Kumanica served as an important local or regional spiritual center. It provided a place of worship, spiritual guidance, and potentially refuge for people living in the Lim River valley and surrounding areas.
Being on a route (the Lim valley), it may also have offered hospitality to travelers and pilgrims.
Challenges and Later State:

Like many monasteries in the Balkans, Kumanica suffered significant damage and periods of abandonment, particularly during the long era of Ottoman rule and later conflicts. This is why less medieval fabric survives compared to continuously active or better-protected sites.
In summary, during medieval times (likely from the late 13th or 14th century onwards), Kumanica Monastery was an active Serbian Orthodox monastic community in the Lim River gorge. It was an authentic medieval foundation, dedicated to the Archangel Michael, housing monks, featuring medieval architecture and frescoes, and serving as a local or regional spiritual center, despite facing the considerable challenges that led to its later decline before its more recent revival.";

Today, the Mažići Monastery is under the protection of Republic of Serbia, as cultural monument of great importance,[1] and at the beginning of 21st century the monastery and church was renovated, while work on the renovation of the entire complex continues.

History
It was created in 12th century, during the reign of Stefan Nemanjic (1166–1196). The monastery complex was demolished and rebuilt on several occasions, and was permanently abandoned at the beginning 18th century.[1] Archaeological research complex showed his great age as a cult place, finds from prehistory, and among the most significant finds are the remains of a hospital from the time of the king Milutin (1282—1321), in which medieval relics were found.

The location of the monastery itself is a old cult place. During the archeological excavations of the complex, prehistoric burial mounds were found from Bronze Age, Roman graves, as well as the foundations of a church with necropolis (from 9th and 10th century). During 12th century was erected the monastery Orahovic, which is first mentioned at the beginning 13th century, in Studenica Typicon and then it was among the most important in the country. He was probably killed, In the middle 13th century, archbishop Danilo II states that it was restored by the king Milutin. The monastery suffered a new destruction in 1667, after which it was renewed and mentioned in the sources at 1683 and at the beginning of 18th century, after which it was permanently deserted.

Banja Monastery near Priboj. This is the most prominent one likely being referred to when discussing a medieval ""Banja Monastery"" in Serbia.

Here's a breakdown of its importance in medieval times:

Location: It is located near the town of Priboj, in southwestern Serbia, a region historically part of Raška, the core of the medieval Serbian state.
Period: Its origins are ancient, possibly pre-dating the Nemanjić dynasty, but it gained major significance and its current form largely during the 13th and 14th centuries, particularly under Kings Stefan Uroš I and Stefan Dušan.
Exceptional Status: Seat of a Bishopric/Metropolitanate: Unlike most monasteries which were purely monastic communities, Banja near Priboj was the seat of the Bishopric (later Metropolitanate) of Dabar and Bosnia. This gave it immense importance beyond just being a monastery. It was an administrative center for a large ecclesiastical region within the Serbian Orthodox Church.
Architectural Style: The main church (dedicated to St. Nicholas) reflects the Raška architectural school, typical of the Nemanjić era (roughly 12th-13th centuries), characterized by a blend of Byzantine and Romanesque influences. It has a distinctive dome and once featured significant fresco decoration (parts of which are preserved).
Historical Significance: As a bishopric seat, it was a major center of spiritual, administrative, and cultural life. It was tied directly to the hierarchy of the Serbian Church and, through the bishop, had connections to the royal court and regional nobility. It played a crucial role in the organization and spread of Orthodox Christianity in the surrounding areas, including parts of Bosnia.
Activities in medieval times (reflecting its status as a bishopric and monastery):

Ecclesiastical Administration: This was a primary function. The resident Bishop (or Metropolitan) oversaw the clergy and church life across the vast Diocese of Dabar and Bosnia. This involved ordinations, canonical visitations, settling church disputes, and maintaining order within the church structure.
Spiritual and Liturgical Life: It functioned as a monastery, with a community of monks dedicated to prayer, asceticism, and performing religious services according to the Orthodox rite. The services would have been particularly solemn and grand given the presence of the bishop.
Cultural and Artistic Center: As a major religious hub, it housed a scriptorium where religious texts, liturgical books, chronicles, and official documents were copied and illuminated. It was a center for fresco painting and icon creation.
Repository of Knowledge and Archives: As an administrative center, it likely held important church records, charters, and theological works.
Economic Activity: Bishoprics and large monasteries were typically endowed with lands and resources by rulers and nobility, making them significant economic entities managing agriculture, forests, etc.
Social and Political Influence: The Bishop of Dabar and Bosnia was a significant figure in the region, giving the monastery influence in secular affairs as well, mediating disputes, advising rulers, and being a point of contact for the local population.
In summary, Banja Monastery near Priboj was not just a medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery; it was a hugely important bishopric seat that served as a major administrative, spiritual, cultural, and even economic center within the medieval Serbian state, particularly during the height of the Nemanjić dynasty. Its activities were diverse and central to the life of the Church and the region it served.";
Crna Reka Monastery;Serbian Orthodox;Archangel Michael;Saint Mary;1250;2025;775;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Ribariće;42,9722;20,4564;Female;;;;personal research NY;;"Milica of Serbia ; Church of Archangel Michael. Crna Reka (Black River) Monastery is a unique and significant Serbian Orthodox monastery with origins in the medieval period.

Here are its key aspects regarding medieval times:

Location: It's located in a remote, rugged gorge near Novi Pazar, southwestern Serbia. Its most striking feature is that the main church is built within a large cave.
Period: Tradition attributes its founding or early existence to the time of King Stefan Uroš I (mid-13th century), placing it firmly within the core Nemanjić era. While the exact date and founder are not definitively documented, the style of some architectural elements and the historical context support a medieval origin.
Unique Nature: The cave setting makes it different from most other Serbian monasteries. This location suggests a focus on seclusion, asceticism, and hermitage from its earliest days.
Architectural Style: The architecture is primarily dictated by the cave itself. While some later additions and reconstructions exist, the core structure inside the cave reflects adaptation to the natural environment rather than adherence to specific medieval architectural schools like Raška or Morava in the same way as freestanding churches. There are frescoes inside, parts of which may date back to earlier periods, but extensive medieval fresco cycles like those in larger monasteries are not its primary characteristic.
Activities in medieval times:

Due to its remote and secluded location, the activities at Crna Reka in the medieval period would have likely focused primarily on:

Ascetic Life and Prayer: The cave setting is ideal for hermitage and intense spiritual devotion. Monks would have dedicated themselves to prayer, fasting, and solitary contemplation, following a more rigorous ascetic path than in larger, more accessible monasteries.
Small Monastic Community: It would have housed a small number of monks living communally within the cave complex, supporting each other in their spiritual endeavors.
Limited Interaction: Compared to monasteries on major routes or near population centers, interaction with the outside world would have been limited, perhaps primarily for obtaining necessary supplies or providing spiritual guidance to a small number of dedicated pilgrims.
Copying of Religious Texts (Likely on a Smaller Scale): Like most monasteries, they would have possessed and likely copied religious texts, but perhaps not on the scale of the large scriptoria found in royal monasteries.
While Crna Reka gained significant importance later as a refuge for holy relics (famously housing the relics of Stefan Prvovenčani, i.e., Saint Simon the Monk, for a period during Ottoman times) and as a center of resistance and spiritual preservation, its role in the medieval period itself appears to have been that of a more private, secluded, and ascetic monastic dwelling, rooted in the traditions of hermitage within the Serbian Orthodox Church. Its longevity and unique location make it a fascinating example of different forms of monastic life present in medieval Serbia.";
Hebdów;Premonstratensian;;Saint Mary;1148;1815;667;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss;Poland;POL;Hebdów;50,1500;20,4167;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Hebdów [ˈxɛbduf] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Nowe Brzesko, within Proszowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland.[1] It lies approximately 3 kilometres (2 mi) north-east of Nowe Brzesko, 10 km (6 mi) south-east of Proszowice, and 36 km (22 mi) east of the regional capital Kraków.

Hebdów is famous across the region for its Norbertine Abbey, which was founded in the first half of the 12th century (one of the bells at the abbey bears the date 1108). The historic complex (the abbey together with a church) currently belongs to the Piarists. It is home to a sanctuary of Our Lady of Hebdów (Matka Boska Hebdowska), and the 45-meter tall towers of the church are visible from a large distance.


Abbey church at Hebdów
The history of the abbey dates back to the year 1146, when two knights of High Duke of Poland, Bolesław IV the Curly, invited here Premonstratensian monks from Strahov Monastery in the Kingdom of Bohemia. The abbey at Hebdów became a branch of the Czech monastery, with first monks having been of Czech origin, and the first abbot a German man named Wosolanus, who died in 1179. Originally, both monks and nuns lived at Hebdów. After some time however, Norbertine nuns moved to the village of Zwierzyniec, which now is a district of Kraków. In 1279, wójt Gotfryd of Ślezino founded the town of Nowe Brzesko, located only three kilometers from Hebdów. The town remained property of the monastery until the 19th century. In the Middle Ages, Hebdów Abbey emerged as a regional center of the Norbertines. It controlled other abbeys, at Witów, Nowy Sącz, Zwierzyniec, Imbramowice, Busko Zdrój, Płock and Krzyżanowice.

The decline of the abbey was brought about by the Protestant Reformation. Furthermore, the abbots at Hebdów were selected by Polish Kings, which had negative consequences, as they were more interested in profits than in spiritual discipline of their monks. In the mid-17th century, the church was expanded by abbot Ludwik Stępkowski, who later became the Bishop of Kamieniec Podolski. Several new ornaments, altars and paintings were added to the church at that time, including the so-called Oratorio Chapel. The new, remodelled church was blessed by Bishop Mikołaj Oborski on May 31, 1678.

After the Partitions of Poland Hebdów briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War I. In 1819, Russians took control over the complex, taking away the abbey’s library, with its precious collection of ancient prints and books. In 1859 the church burned, and services were temporarily moved to Nowe Brzesko. Since 1949, the complex has been administered by the Piarists. Arguably, the most famous of the Hebdów abbots was Józef Andrzej Załuski.";

The monastery is situated near the village of Јаkovo, 25 km from Belgrade, former Municipality of Zemun and now Surčin.[1] Although geographically it does not belong to Fruška gora there is a huge historical connection with Fruška gora monasteries. The monastery church was dedicated to St. Martyr Paraskeva (celebrated on 26 July, that is, 8 August according to the new calendar). According to the folk tradition, the monastery was built in the second half of the 15th century and its founders were Stefan and Аngelina Branković. The first written record[2] about the monastery is found in the minej (religious liturgy book) of the monk Zaharije from 1563. Unlike other Fruška gora monasteries, Fenek remained under the Ottoman government until 1717. The records from the 18th century testify that the old monastery church was built in the second half of the 15th century in the spirit of Serbian medieval architecture.[3] The new church was built in the period from 1793-1797, and consecrated during the time when Vikentije Rakić was the abbot; he also wrote the history of the monastery. The monastery chapel dedicated to St Petka was built in 1800, on the site of the old one, above the well, which was believed to have been built by the mother Angelina Branković. People believed that the water from this well had some healing powers.[4] By the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the Fenek Monastery was the venue of the several historical events. In 1788, duke Aleksa Nenadović and Austrian emperor Јоsef II met in the monastery. After the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising in 1813 Karađorđe and his son Aleksa stayed in a monastery for a month. There is a memorial plaque as a testimony. Also on the same occasion, until 1815, monks from Studenica stayed there, along with the relics of St. King Stefan Prvovenčani. The monastery was also the place where Karađorđe met archpriest Маtija Nenadović. In the First World War the monastery was set on fire, and in the Second World War in 1942 it was almost completely devastated.";

It is dedicated to Saint Achillius of Larissa, a fighter against Arianism and participant of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The church was built in 1296 by Serbian King Stefan Dragutin of the Nemanjić dynasty and is located in the center of town, on the elevated plateau above the large river valley and the river Moravica and Big Rzav, and represents the most dominant object in the Arilje region.

History

Stefan Nemanja's council, from the church.
The church was built in 1296 by King Stefan Dragutin of the Nemanjić dynasty, on the location of an earlier monastery built in 1219. The earlier monastery was the seat of the Bishop of Moravica, one of twelve eparchies established by Archbishop Sava in 1219.

It is dedicated to Saint Achillius from Larissa (Greece), a fighter against Arianism and participant of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. God made him celebrate victory over Arianism, making a miracle to Achillius confession of the truth water runs from stone.[clarification needed][1]";
Beška Monastery (island of Beška, Serbia);Serbian Orthodox;The Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary;Saint Michael Archangel;1439;2025;586;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Beška;45,12972222;20,06611111;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"ÄuraÄ‘ II BalÅ¡iÄ‡ ; ÄuraÄ‘ II BalÅ¡iÄ‡, Jelena BalÅ¡iÄ‡ ; Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. Beška Monastery (Manastir Beška), located on the island of Beška in Lake Skadar. This is a significant Serbian Orthodox monastery with a fascinating history rooted in the medieval period of Zeta.

Unlike some monasteries whose medieval origins are debated, Beška has clear medieval foundations tied to the ruling Balšić dynasty of Zeta. It's unique in that it comprises two separate churches on the same island, both founded in the late medieval period.

Here's a breakdown:

Location: Island of Beška, in the Serbian historical region of Zeta, located within modern-day Montenegro, in Lake Skadar. This region was closely connected to the medieval Serbian state.
Founders & Period:
Church of St. George: Founded by Đurađ II Balšić (Đurađ Stracimirović Balšić), the ruler of Zeta, in the late 14th century (around 1385 or shortly after). This makes it a royal foundation from the time just before and after the Battle of Kosovo.
Church of the Mother of God (or Dormition of the Mother of God): Founded by Jelena Balšić, wife of Đurađ II Balšić and daughter of the famous Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, in the early 15th century (around 1407-1409). This is also a significant medieval foundation by a prominent female figure linked to both the Zeta and Serbian ruling dynasties. Jelena later became a nun with the name Jevgenija and resided here.
Architectural Style: The churches on the islands of Lake Skadar, including Beška, typically feature simpler architecture compared to the large monasteries further north. They are usually single-nave structures, often with domes, reflecting local building traditions combined with Byzantine influences. St. George is a single-nave church, and the Mother of God is also a single-nave church with a dome, built in the architectural style characteristic of the time and region.
Historical Significance:
Royal Patronage: As foundations of the ruling Balšić family, the monasteries on Beška held high status and received significant support.
Burial Place: Đurađ II Balšić was buried in the Church of St. George, highlighting its importance as a mortuary church for the dynasty.
Center of Culture and Literacy: Jelena Balšić was a highly educated woman who fostered literacy. The monastery on Beška was associated with the creation of the Gorički Zbornik, a significant collection of manuscripts compiled by the monk Nikon of Jerusalem at the request of Jelena Balšić on the nearby island of Gorica. This firmly establishes Beška's connection to medieval Serbian literacy and scholarship in Zeta.
Spiritual Hub in Zeta: The islands of Lake Skadar, including Beška, became important centers of Orthodox monastic life and resistance during the turbulent late medieval period, as the Serbian state faced decline and eventual conquest. They served as bastions of faith and identity.
Activities in medieval times:

Given its status as a royal foundation and a center of literacy in Zeta:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: Both monasteries (though perhaps functioning somewhat together on the island) served as centers for monastic life, prayer, ascetic practice, and the daily cycle of Orthodox divine services. The Church of the Mother of God likely housed a community of nuns, possibly led by Jelena (Jevgenija).
Cultural and Intellectual Activity: This was a major role, especially linked to Jelena Balšić.
Scriptorium: There was definitely a scriptorium where important religious texts, liturgical books, and scholarly works (like the Gorički Zbornik) were copied and compiled.
Repository of Knowledge: The monasteries housed valuable manuscripts and religious books.
Patronage of Learning: Jelena's presence ensured patronage for intellectual pursuits.
Royal Association: The monasteries were linked to the ruling family, serving as a place of prayer for the dynasty, a burial site (St. George), and a residence for a former ruler (Jelena/Jevgenija).
Local Religious Life: While an island location limits direct interaction with a large lay population, the monasteries served the spiritual needs of any nearby settlements reachable by boat and were symbols of Orthodox presence in the region.
Economic Management: The monasteries would have managed lands and resources provided by the Balšić rulers and other donors to support the monastic communities.
In summary, Beška Monastery on Lake Skadar was a genuinely significant medieval Serbian Orthodox complex, consisting of two churches founded by the ruling Balšić family in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It was a spiritual center, a royal burial place, and importantly, a notable center of literacy and manuscript production in the region of Zeta, particularly associated with the influential figure of Jelena Balšić.";

Camaldolese Monastery;Camaldolese ;;Saint Mary;1609;2025;416;Secularization;Poland;POL;Kraków;50,0621;19,9369;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"Looming white over the green woods of Srebrna Góra (Silver Mountain) are the towers of the Camaldolese monastery: one of only two operating in Poland. The area – Bielany – took its name from the characteristic white habits of the monks.

The hermit order was introduced to Poland by Mikołaj Wolski, Grand Marshal of the Crown, in 1603. The monks sought a location that was cut off from the hubbub of daily life, so that they could find peace to praise the Creator. They chose Pagórki świętego Stanisława, literally the knolls of St Stanislaus, that belonged to Sebastian Lubomirski, who was loath to sell his estate. It was Anna Lubomirska, future wife of the owner, who proved helpful for the transaction by suggesting that Wolski threw a splendid banquet. In a festive mood, the merry Lubomirski promised the wooded hills to his host. In gratitude, Wolski presented him with all the silverware used at the table. Hence the name of the hill on which the Hermitage stands.

Soon the first houses of the hermits were built: following the rules of the order, each became home to one monk. The construction of the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary began, designed by Italian architect Andrea Spezza. The lavish furnishing of the church dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries. The founder of the church, Mikołaj Wolski, who died in 1630, is buried in a crypt by the entrance to the church. Following his wish, he was buried in a Camaldolese habit. The vaults of the choir hold a chapel and a crypt in which the earthly remains of the deceased monks are immured. After a hundred years, the ashes were exhumed and transferred to a communal grave, to make room for subsequent monks. The entire monastic complex has endured until the present in a nearly unaltered condition.

The Monastery in Bielany was often visited by Polish kings, notably Ladislaus IV Vasa (Władysław IV Waza) and John Casimir (Jan Kazimierz) during the so-called Swedish Deluge, and John (Jan) III Sobieski before he set forth to relieve Vienna from the Ottoman siege. In 2002, the monks were visited by Pope John Paul II, who remarked that: People of Kraków: do you know who to thank for your city staying safe and unviolated for so many centuries? Your lightning rod is the Camaldolese!

The Camaldolese is an order of monastic hermits. Each monk lives in his hermitage, they only meet for mass and prayers, and they gather for communal meals only a few times a year. They can only talk to each other three times a week: on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Praying in the church, the Camaldolese use no organ or any other musical instrument. There is no radio or TV-set in the monastery, nor are holiday leaves or family visits permitted. It may be worth adding that the Monte Corona Camaldolese congregation encompasses today just nine monasteries all over the world (of which two are in Poland), and nearly every other monk is a Pole. Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Kraków (Polish: Kościół Wniebowzięcia Najświętszej Maryi Panny w Krakowie) is a Camaldolese priory in Bielany in Kraków, Poland.[1] The monastery is located on the 326-metre (1,070 ft) Silver Mount. It consists of hermitages and the Assumption of Mary Church.

History
The Camaldolese monks were invited to settle in Bieleany by Grand Court Marshal Mikołaj Wolski in 1603. The monastery was built between 1609 and 1630. The construction of the building was supervised by Walenty von Säbisch but after the collapse of part of the monastery the supervision over the works was subsequently taken over by Italian architect Andrea Spezza. By 1630, the monastery was completed according to his plans.

Throughout its history the monastery was visited by such kings as John III Sobieski, Władysław IV Vasa, John II Casimir and Stanisław August Poniatowski. On 19 August 2002, the church was visited by Pope John Paul II during his pilgrimage to Poland.[2]

Okay, let's discuss Banjska Monastery (Манастир Бањска) and its role within the Serbian Orthodox Church during medieval times.
Banjska is one of the most important Serbian medieval monasteries, primarily due to its founder and its intended purpose.
Here's what was notable about it in the medieval period:
Location: Situated in northern Kosovo, near the town of Banjska, not far from Zvečan and Mitrovica. This location was central to the medieval Serbian state (Raška).
Founder and Foundation (Early 14th Century):

The monastery was founded and built by one of the most powerful Serbian medieval rulers, King Stefan Uroš II Milutin (reigned 1282–1321).
Construction of the main church, dedicated to Saint Stephen Protomartyr, took place between 1313 and 1317.
Primary Medieval Purpose: Royal Necropolis:

Milutin explicitly intended Banjska to be his mausoleum, his royal burial place. This was a profound statement of its importance. He prepared a detailed charter (the Banjska Charter, 1317) outlining the monastery's organization, property, and privileges, ensuring its perpetual grandeur and spiritual function.
After his death in 1321, Milutin was indeed buried in the monastery. However, due to later historical events (Ottoman expansion, the monastery being damaged), his relics were later moved for safekeeping and are now kept at the Church of St Nedelya (Sveta Nedelya) in Sofia, Bulgaria. Despite this, its initial and primary role was as the grand burial site for the king.
Architectural Significance:

The main church of Banjska is considered a masterpiece of the Raška architectural school, the dominant style in central Serbia during the 13th and early 14th centuries.
It combines elements of Byzantine and Romanesque architecture. It is particularly known for its three-nave basilica plan with domes and its elaborate use of colored stone (red and light) on the exterior, along with rich sculptural decoration (portals, windows, friezes) executed by masters likely from the Adriatic coast. This was a level of exterior decoration not typical of earlier Raška churches like Studenica.
Rich Endowment and Economic Power:

According to Milutin's charter, Banjska was lavishly endowed with numerous villages, vast lands, and even rights to various resources (like iron mines). This made it an incredibly wealthy and economically powerful institution in medieval Serbia, capable of sustaining a large community of monks and maintaining its grandeur.
Monastic Community and Spiritual Role:

As a major royal foundation, it housed a significant community of monks dedicated to prayer for the king's soul and the well-being of the state, as well as daily liturgical life.
It served as an important spiritual center in the heartland of the Serbian kingdom.
Artistic Aspirations:

While not as much of the original medieval fresco painting has survived as at sites like Gračanica (also a Milutin foundation), the monastery was intended to be fully decorated with frescoes, reflecting the high artistic standards of the time. The surviving fragments and the quality of the architecture indicate the ambition for it to be a complete artistic synthesis.
In summary, Banjska Monastery during medieval times, particularly in the early 14th century, was a paramount royal foundation built by King Milutin to serve as his grand mausoleum and the spiritual heart of his kingdom. It was an architectural jewel of the Raška school, lavishly endowed, and housed a significant monastic community, standing as a powerful symbol of Serbian statehood, piety, and artistic achievement at the peak of its medieval power.";

It was completely demolished in July 1999 by Kosovo-Albanian militants.[2]

History
It was founded in the 14th century on the Rusinica hill above Mušutište, in the District of Branković, part of Medieval Serbia. The monastery’s existence in written records was first dated to 1465. It was well known for its valuable collection of manuscripts dating from the 14th to the 18th century. Particularly noted were a 'Book of Commemoration' from 1465 and a hand-written Gospel from the 14th century. The monastery also treasured a collection of wooden icons from the 1800s.[3][4]

In June 1999, the Monastery of Holy Trinity in Mušutište was looted by Albanian militants and in July of the same year it was completely blown up. The fire after the explosion destroyed all the buildings in the church courtyard, along with the nearby Church of the Holy Theotokos Hodigetria and the ancient manuscripts.[5][6]";

There were two layers of frescoes, one on top of the other. The newer layer, from the 16th century, showed archbishops at liturgy. [2]

It was located near the town of Viti. The monastery was destroyed in June 1999, by Albanians.  Binač Monastery in medieval times:

Location: Located near the town of Vitina, in the Anamorava valley in Kosovo. This region was part of the medieval Serbian state.
Period: The monastery has medieval origins, with traditions linking its founding to the 14th century, possibly during the reigns of King Stefan Milutin or Emperor Stefan Dušan. This places it firmly within the height of the medieval Serbian Empire.
Historical Significance: Binač was an active Serbian Orthodox monastery during the medieval period. It served as a spiritual center for the local population and the monastic community.
Architectural Style: The medieval church of the monastery, dedicated to the Holy Archangel Michael, followed the typical style of Serbian medieval church architecture from the 14th century – likely a cross-in-square plan with a dome, reflecting the dominant Byzantine architectural tradition adopted and adapted by the Serbian state.
Current State: Sadly, the medieval church and monastery complex suffered significant destruction, particularly in recent conflicts. The medieval church is largely in ruins, although some conservation efforts have been made. This makes comprehensive archaeological and historical study challenging.
Activities in medieval times:

Based on its status as a medieval monastery (though not a major royal foundation like Studenica or Gračanica):

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The primary focus would have been the monastic routine of prayer, fasting, and performing the daily cycle of Orthodox divine services for the monastic community.
Serving the Local Population: It would have served as a local spiritual hub, providing religious services (baptisms, weddings, funerals) and spiritual guidance for the Serbian Orthodox population in the surrounding villages of the Anamorava valley.
Cultural Activity (Likely on a Local Scale): As with most monasteries, it likely had a scriptorium for copying religious texts and liturgical books needed for services and the education of monks. It would have been a repository of religious knowledge.
Economic Subsistence: The monastery would have relied on land endowments or contributions from the local population for its sustenance, likely engaging in agriculture.
In summary, Binač Monastery near Vitina was a genuine Serbian Orthodox monastery founded in the medieval period (likely the 14th century). While not a major royal or artistic center on the scale of the most famous Serbian monasteries, it was an important local spiritual hub, serving the monastic community and the surrounding population within the medieval Serbian state. Its history is significant, though much of its medieval physical fabric has been lost due to later destruction.";

The monastery has a Byzantine-orthodox architecture but with many romanesque features, which lies in a surface of 2.500 meters square. It is composed of the Saint Mary Church, the chapel of the Saint Trinity, a mill, and a barn.[5] The Church of Saint Mary in the Monastery of Ardenica has important frescos from Kostandin Zografi and Athanas Zografi. These painters from Korçë worked on the church in 1744. The frescos include an Old Testament and a New Testament, Dogmatica, Lithurgy, Life of Saints, etc.[5];"Built in the 13th century, the Byzantine monastery of Ardenica (Manastiri i Ardenicës) is one of the few remaining monasteries in Albania with monks living there. According to a legend, the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg was married there. The central element of the monastery near the city of Fier is the church of the Virgin Mary with a high bell tower. It is thought that in 1451, the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg was married here. The fact is said to have saved the building from demolition during the communist atheisation campaign in the 1960s. From 1967, the building was used by the army as a barracks and later became a hotel for tourists. Since 1992 it has been converted back to a monastery.

The Church of the Virgin Mary, which was constructed in the Byzantine style with Romanesque elements, is part of the complex spanning 2500 square metres. A wooden pulpit with carvings is located inside. In addition, there are several monks’ cells, the chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, an oil press, and a barn.  Its name, ""Ardenica,"" is probably derived from a pagan temple dedicated to Artemis that was built on the site before the monastery was built.

In 1282, on the initiative of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologus of Byzantium, it is believed that the foundations of this monastery were laid. It arose after a victory of the emperor over the Angevins in Berat. During the Ottoman rule, the monastery continued to play an important role, becoming the place of the coronation of the national hero Gjergj Kastrioti, otherwise known as Skenderbeu, with Andronika Arianiti on April 21, 1451.

The monastery has a characteristic medieval architecture and is a holy center for believers. It is carefully preserved and constitutes an important cultural and religious destination in Albania. The monastery church has witnessed important historical and cultural moments, adding a special emotional and historical dimension for visitors. Today, the monastery is open to visitors and believers who want to get to know its rich heritage and feel the spirit of this holy place.

The monastery was built in 1282 by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II. Palaiologos. Since the end of the 18th century, a theological school with a richly equipped library was operating here, but it was burnt down in a fire in 1932.An. dronikos II Palaiologos The Monastery of the Nativity of the Theotokos in Ardenica[1] (Albanian: Manastiri Lindja e Hyjlindëses Mari,;[2][3] or simply Ardenica Monastery (Albanian: Manastiri i Ardenices) is an Albanian Orthodox monastery, located 18 kilometers south of Lushnjë, Albania, along the national road that links Lushnjë to Fier.[4]

Built by Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1282, after the victory against the Angevins in the siege of Berat, the monastery is famous as the place where, in 1451, the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg married Andronika Arianiti. In 1780 the Monastery started a theological school to prepare clerics in Greek Orthodoxy. It had an important library with 32,000 volumes, which was destroyed by a fire in 1932. The Church of Saint Mary within the monastery contains frescos by the Albanian Zografi Brothers, notably one of saint John Kukuzelis, born in Durrës, Albania.

History
Scholars claim that the Byzantine Emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos started building the monastery in 1282 after the victory against the Angevins in the siege of Berat.[5] The chapel of Saint Trinity was already there, erected centuries before. A pagan temple, dedicated to Artemis had existed on the site before the chapel, and it is thought that the name of Ardenica stems from Artemis.[4][6] The monastery site lies approximately 1 km from the Via Egnatia (a major 2nd century Roman road). On April 21, 1451 in this monastery was celebrated the marriage of George Kastrioti with Andronika Arianiti.[7] The archbishop of Kanina, Felix said the mess in the wedding in the presence of all the Albanian princes, members of the League of Lezhë and the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Naples, Republic of Venice, and Republic of Ragusa. This is mentioned first by A. Lorenzoni in 1940.[5]

One of the most important clerics of the monastery, Nektarios Terpos from Moscopole, wrote in 1731 a short prayer in the form of a fresco. The prayer is in four languages: Latin, Greek, Aromanian and Albanian. This fact is important because it is the first text in Albanian written in a Byzantine-era church. The Albanian text reads Vigjin dhe mame e Perendis uro pren fajt orete.[4][dead link] This multilingual short prayer also constitutes the oldest known text in the Aromanian language.[8] It is written using the Greek alphabet, like all other languages in the inscription except Latin. The inscription is Βήργιρι Μᴕμάλ τᴕμνεζί ώρε τρέ νοι πεκιτό..λοι, in modern Aromanian spelling Viryiră, muma-al Dumnedză, oră tră noi pecătoshlji, meaning ""Virgin Mother of God, pray for us sinners"". It has been classified as belonging to a northern Aromanian dialect.[9] At the end the prayers are signed Hieromonk - Nektarios Terpos the monk.[4][dead link]

In 1743 me with the initiative of the Berat's archbishop, Methodius, who was originary of Bubullimë, Lushnjë District, western Albania, then Ottoman Empire, the monastery was renovated: the paintings from this period of the Zografi brothers pertain to this time.[5]

Since 1780, in the Monastery existed a Greek school to prepare clerics.[4] In 1817, the school became a high school, which had also a student house. From this school graduated the Bishop of Berat, Josif.[4] During the Albanian National Awakening period the school became one of the places where the Albanian Language was taught.[4]

An important cleric of the monastery was Father Mark, who was the priest to find the bones of Saint Cosmas of Aetolia, thrown in the Seman by the Turkish chevaliers.[4]

The monastery had an exceptional library of 32,000 volumes that got completely burned by a fire in 1932.[4]

By the late 1960s in this monastery spent the last days of his life the former primate of the Albanian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Irene Banushi.[4] In 1967, when the atheist campaign in the People's Republic of Albania was in full swing, the monastery was saved from demolition due to the intervention of a local priest who stated that Skanderbeg was said to have been married there.[10]

The monastery was closed for the public and for clerical duties in 1969 as the communist regime declared Albania an atheist state. The buildings and its surroundings were left in a state of decay for many years until 1988 when a partial reconstruction took place for tourism purposes. The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania retook possession of the monastery in 1992 after the fall of the communist regime in Albania.";

The Mileševa monastery was founded between 1234 and 1236 by Serbian King Vladislav. The monastery is situated in a valley of the Mileševa River, near Prijepolje. Mileševa is one of the most important Serbian sanctuaries and spiritual centers. In 1236, Vladislav moved the relics of his uncle Saint Sava from Trnovo in Bulgaria, where he died, to Mileševa. Some historians believe that the coronation of Tvrtko I as King of the Serbs and Bosnia in 1377,[2] took place in Mileševa.[3] In the 15th century, the monastery was the seat of the Metropolitanate of Dabar-Bosnia. In 1459, the Ottomans set the monastery on fire,[citation needed] but it was soon restored. In the first half of the 16th century, the first service books were illuminated in the Mileševa printing house.[4] One of the oldest schools also existed in the monastery. In the middle of the century, during the time of Patriarch Makarije (the Serbian Patriarchate was restored in 1557), the monastery was thoroughly renovated. Its external narthex was built and painted and probably cut through the wall between the narthex and the nave. In later times, after several Ottoman military engagements,[5] a new restoration was undertaken in 1863 when the church considerably changed in appearance.

The Mileševa monastery has been frequently visited by pilgrims and various travellers, including Cornelis de Schepper,[6] some of them leaving records of their visits.[7] The monastery also received donations by Russian Emperors (Ivan IV Vasilyevich) and Wallachian and Moldavian rulers. In 1594, the Ottomans removed the relics of Saint Sava from the monastery and publicly burned them on Vračar hill in Belgrade, making him thus a posthumous martyr. On 27 October 1941, the Communist forces broke into the monastery and killed its hegumen Nestor Trkulja.[8]

Mileševa was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.";
Moračnik Monastery (Montenegro);Serbian Orthodox;0;Saint Nicolas;1400;2025;625;Ottoman rule;Montenegro;MNE;Shkodër;42,06666667;19,5;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"BalÅ¡a III[1] ; Eparchy of Budimlja-NikÅ¡iÄ‡. Moračnik Monastery (Манастир Морачник) on Lake Skadar in Montenegro during medieval times.

Moračnik is one of several important island monasteries in the region, and its medieval history is significant for the history of Zeta (a medieval Serbian state that is the predecessor of modern Montenegro) and its transition into the early modern period.

Here's what was notable about Moračnik Monastery in the medieval period:

Location: It is situated on an island of the same name in the southwestern part of Lake Skadar (Skadarsko Jezero). Its island location provided some isolation and protection, characteristic of monastic life in this unique environment.

Foundation (Early 15th Century):

The monastery was founded by Lord Balša III (reigned 1403-1421), the last ruler of the Balšić dynasty in Zeta.
The foundation is traditionally placed around 1417. It was dedicated to the Most Holy Theotokos (Holy Mother of God).
As a princely foundation, it was intended to be a significant spiritual center and an expression of the piety and authority of the Balšić rulers.
Monastic Life and Spiritual Role:

Moračnik housed a community of Serbian Orthodox monks who followed monastic rules, dedicating themselves to prayer, worship, and ascetic practices.
It served the spiritual needs of the people in the Lake Skadar region, contributing to the preservation of Orthodox faith and culture in a time of increasing external pressures.
Architectural Remnants:

The main church, dedicated to the Mother of God, dates from the early 15th-century foundation period. It is built in the typical architectural style of the churches in the Lake Skadar area during this time, blending Byzantine influences with local characteristics. The monastery complex also included other structures like cells and potentially defensive features given its location.
The Printing Press (Late Medieval / Early Modern): This is one of the most famous aspects of Moračnik's history, though it falls right at the very end of the traditional medieval period or the cusp of the early modern.

In the late 15th century (specifically 1493-1496), Đurađ Crnojević, the ruler of Zeta following the Balšićs, established one of the first Cyrillic printing presses in the world at Cetinje, but it is sometimes associated with the monasteries on Lake Skadar, including Moračnik. While the primary printing took place at Cetinje, the intellectual environment and possibly preparatory work or backup activities were linked to these monastic centers. This activity represents a remarkable effort to preserve Orthodox literature and culture through printing in the face of the encroaching Ottoman Empire.
Historical Context and Challenges: Founded as the Ottoman threat was growing, the monastery faced significant challenges. The fall of Zeta to the Ottomans meant that monasteries like Moračnik entered a period of decline, damage, or abandonment in the post-medieval era.

In summary, during medieval times (specifically the early 15th century), Moračnik Monastery was a princely foundation of the Balšić dynasty on an island in Lake Skadar, serving as a significant spiritual center for a community of monks. Its architecture reflects the regional style of the period. It is particularly notable for its association with the very late medieval/early modern effort to establish a Cyrillic printing press in Zeta under the Crnojevićs, highlighting its role in the preservation of Orthodox culture in a challenging era.";

Orahovo Monastery (Manastir Orahovo) near Bar, Montenegro, is indeed a Serbian Orthodox monastery with a history tied to the medieval period, though perhaps not as widely documented as some of the large royal foundations further north in Serbia.

Here's what's known about it in the context of medieval times and activities:

Location: Situated in the village of Orahovo, near Virpazar, within the Municipality of Bar, Montenegro. This region (historically part of Zeta) was closely linked to the medieval Serbian state.
Period: While the exact founding date is debated, tradition and some sources place its origin in the late medieval period, possibly in the 14th or 15th century. Some traditions associate its establishment or significant renovation with the time of the Crnojević dynasty, who ruled Zeta in the 15th century and were patrons of Orthodoxy (like the founding of Cetinje Monastery).
Significance: Orahovo Monastery likely served primarily as a local religious center for the surrounding community. Monasteries in Zeta during this turbulent late medieval period, facing pressure from various powers (Venetians, Ottomans), were crucial for preserving Orthodox faith and identity.
Architecture: The church of the monastery is dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God. While the current structure has likely undergone significant rebuilding and renovations over the centuries, it might retain some elements or follow the plan of the medieval foundation. Churches in this region often combined local building traditions with influences from broader Byzantine and Serbian styles.
Activities in medieval times:

Based on the nature of such monasteries in the region and era:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The core activity would have been the monastic routine of prayer, fasting, and daily divine services according to the Serbian Orthodox tradition. It would have housed a small community of monks.
Serving the Local Population: The monastery would have provided spiritual guidance, performed baptisms, weddings, and funerals for the villagers of Orahovo and nearby settlements.
Preservation of Faith and Identity: In a region often contested by different powers and religions, monasteries like Orahovo were vital custodians of Orthodox Christianity and Serbian cultural identity. They served as symbols of continuity and resistance.
Literacy and Culture (Likely on a Modest Scale): Like other monasteries, it would have possessed religious books and might have had a small scriptorium for copying necessary texts, although probably not on the scale of major metropolitan or royal foundations.
Economic Subsistence: The monastery would have relied on modest land endowments or contributions from the local population for its sustenance, likely engaging in subsistence farming.
In essence, Orahovo Monastery near Bar, if founded in medieval times, would have been a smaller, locally important spiritual center, playing a crucial role in the religious life and identity preservation of its community within the broader context of the medieval Serbian/Zeta state, rather than a major political or artistic hub like the famous monasteries further north.";

Praskvica Monastery (Манастир Прасквица) and its role within the Serbian Orthodox Church during medieval times.

Praskvica is a significant monastery located on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro, near Sveti Stefan and Budva. Its medieval history is closely tied to the local population and ruling dynasties.

Here's what was notable about Praskvica in the medieval period:

Location: Situated in a scenic coastal location overlooking the Adriatic Sea, in the historical region of the Pastrovići tribe (племе Паштровићи).

Foundation (Medieval Period):

The monastery's foundation is traditionally linked to the mid-14th century.
There are traditions associating its founding or significant early patronage with King Stefan Dušan of Serbia, who ruled over this coastal region in the mid-14th century. While direct documented evidence for a grand royal foundation like some others might be scarce for this early period, the tradition of royal involvement suggests it gained importance within the Serbian state's sphere of influence.
Connection to the Pastrovići Tribe: This is a defining characteristic of Praskvica's medieval and later history.

The monastery became the primary spiritual and cultural center for the local Pastrovići tribe.
Throughout the medieval period, the monastery would have been closely supported and maintained by the tribe, serving as their central place of worship, gathering, and identity.
Monastic Life and Activities:

As a monastery, it housed a community of monks living according to Orthodox monastic rules, dedicated to prayer, fasting, and spiritual discipline.
It served the spiritual needs of the local population, including fishermen, sailors, and the people of the surrounding villages.
Given its coastal location and tribal support, it likely played a role beyond purely spiritual functions, potentially in local administration, literacy (though not as renowned as a major scriptorium like Studenica or Mileševa), and economic activities tied to the region (like olive cultivation, which is still important there).
Medieval Church Structures:

The earliest church structures on the site date back to the medieval period, likely from the 14th century. While the main churches existing today are largely later reconstructions due to damage over centuries (from earthquakes, conflicts, etc.), the Church of the Holy Trinity within the complex is believed to retain significant medieval foundations and possibly some original parts, or at least reflects the location of an earlier medieval church. The original medieval church was likely dedicated to Saint Nicholas.
Challenges: Coastal monasteries were vulnerable to various threats during the medieval period, including naval raids, changing political allegiances (between Serbian rulers, Venice, etc.), and later the encroaching Ottoman power.

In summary, during medieval times, Praskvica Monastery, likely founded in the mid-14th century with possible royal Serbian connections, was primarily the crucial spiritual and cultural heart of the Pastrovići tribe. It housed a monastic community serving the local coastal population and maintained the Orthodox faith and identity in the region, despite being subject to the complex political landscape and physical challenges of its coastal location.";

Traditional Founding: Tradition attributes its founding to Despot Stefan Lazarević, placing its origins possibly in the early 15th century. However, concrete historical documentation and preserved architectural remains from the medieval period are scarce.
Historical Evidence: The earliest more reliable historical mentions and the architecture visible today largely date from the 16th century onwards, after the main medieval Serbian state had fallen to the Ottomans. It was rebuilt and restored multiple times throughout history.
Architectural Style: The current church shows features typical of later periods, reflecting renovations and rebuildings rather than a consistent medieval style like the Raška or Morava schools.
Regarding Medieval Times and Activities:

Medieval Presence: While a religious site might have existed there in the late medieval period (15th century), perhaps a smaller church or hermitage, it did not develop into a large, well-documented monastic complex during the height of the medieval Serbian state in the way that the great royal monasteries did. Its significant history and physical structures are primarily post-medieval.
Activities (if it existed as a small site in medieval times): If a monastic presence did exist in the 15th century, its activities would likely have been similar to smaller, less prominent monasteries of the time: focusing primarily on prayer, ascetic life, and perhaps limited copying of religious texts. However, without specific historical records from that time, this is largely speculative, based on the general model of monastic life. It wouldn't have had the role of a major cultural or political center like the royal foundations.
In summary, while Kamenac Monastery is a Serbian Orthodox monastery with a history spanning centuries, its medieval period is not well-documented or architecturally represented. Its significance and preserved history primarily belong to the period after the main medieval era of the independent Serbian state, starting more reliably from the 16th century.";

Order Canons Regular of St Augustine (planned)
Proposed church (none built; only a timber oratory and temporary cloister began)
Approx. site Today’s Mieszno village, gmina Płużnica; 53.354 N, 18.874 E

Summary
The attempt made in the second quarter of the 13th c. to plant an Augustinian canonry in the newly Christianised Chełmno Land never reached stable conventual status. What we know comes from three documents and an entry in the Teutonic Order’s later survey (Inventarium, 1338).

Chronology
• 1226 Bishop Christian of Prussia (the missionary Cistercian) grants the locus Miesno to canons of St Augustine “if they be willing to inhabit it.”
• 1228-30 A handful of canons arrive, probably from Dobrzyń or Czerwińsk, and erect a wooden chapel, but fierce Prussian resistance and a shortage of supplies make the settlement precarious.
• c. 1232 The canons abandon the site; Teutonic Knights fortify the hill and use it as an outpost.
• 1270 Papal bull of Gregory X lists Mieszno among foundations “non incepta vel desertae”—projects never realised or already deserted.
• 14th c. No canonry is re-established; the chapel disappears from the record.

Causes of failure
– Military insecurity during the early Prussian crusades.
– Over-stretch of the parent house (probably Czerwińsk) and lack of endowment.
– Competition from the Teutonic Order, which preferred to support its own houses of Cistercians and Benedictines.

The thing for all of Gotland was located on this strategical location on the middle of the islands, possibly as early as the Viking Age.[1] Usually during the Middle Ages, abbeys like Roma were founded on land donated by the land-owning aristocracy, and the absence of any such group on Gotland may explain the location of the abbey. The land around the thing was common property and could therefore be used for founding an abbey.[1] The abbey was founded in 1164 by Cistercian monks from Nydala Abbey in Småland on mainland Sweden.[2] Its name in Latin was Sancta Maria de Gutnalia.[2] Eventually the abbey grew in importance and acquired large landholdings both on Gotland and in the present-day Baltic states.[2] The abbey had particularly large holdings on Saaremaa island and in present-day mainland Estonia.[1]

During the Reformation, the abbey was disbanded and its lands on Gotland confiscated by the Danish Crown circa 1531 (as Gotland at the time belonged to Denmark).[1] The abbey was converted into the seat of the Danish governor, and the buildings that no longer served any direct purpose were left to decay. After the Peace of Brömsebro in 1645, when Gotland became Swedish, it became the property of the Swedish Crown.[3] In practice, the change of ownership meant few tangible changes for the estate.[4] Towards the end of the 17th century, the Swedish Crown had put the land out for rent as a leasehold estate.[3] In 1728 it befell the governor of Gotland, Johan Didrik Grönhagen. He constructed the manor house, partially using building material from the abbey.";

The monastery was originally built in the 15th or 16th century by the river Trebišnjica and then moved in 1964 upstream to Orah village, near town of Bileća in the eponymous municipality, because its original location was flooded after the completion of the Grančarevo Dam in 1965.
On 17 May 2006, the KONS of Bosnia and Herzegovina designated Dobrićevo Monastery a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

History
There is no written record of the exact date when the Dobrićevo church was built, but two most frequent scholarly opinions put it between the first half of the 15th and early 16th century respectively.[2] Architect Marica Šuput recognized the characteristic architectural elements of the church and the oldest layer of frescoes, which she concluded are placing the Dobrićevo church in the early 16th century.[2][3] Zdravko Kajmaković has also addressed this problem by comparing the church to one other old cruciform church in Sopotnica near Goražde, concluding that it is the only ""analogous"" to the one in Dobrićevo, thus placing Dobričevo into the first half of the 15th century, and its renovation to the early 16th.[2][4]

During its history the monastery was destroyed or damaged several times. It was looted twice, in 1649 and 1680. The same year cistern was built, 1672, the fire swept through the church.damaging the frescoes. From around this period the monastery was abandoned and left unattended until at least 1730, a date of earliest information of its renovation.[2][5] During the 1875–78 uprising, the monastery was plundered.[1] On 5 August 1914, the monastery was seriously damaged by Austro-Hungarian troops, who set the church on fire, destroying the entire iconostasis with many other valuables, such as books and relics, only a portion of which were saved by the monks; the murals were heavily damaged or destroyed.[2][1][6]

Local oral traditions
According to the local legend, the monastery was built on the foundations of earlier Christian basilica which was, built by Constantine the Great and Helena.[7] The legend says that narthex was built after the main church building by members of the Aleksić family whose descendants still lived in nearby Oputna Rudina village at the beginning of the 20th century.[1]

King Magnus also gave his daughter Princess Richeza Magnusdotter of Sweden to the nunnery. She was to serve as its abbess in 1335–1347. The priory was not, however, exclusively for aristocrats, as some other convents were: rather, many of the members and even abbesses were from the merchant class.

The St. Clare's Priory had a close cooperation with the Grey Friar's Abbey, Stockholm, and there is an old legend that they were a secret passage between the two convents. The priory enjoyed prestige. In 1358, it was relieved from all taxes even during a crisis. In 1495, when the regent Sten Sture the elder prepared to go to war against Russia, the Archbishop Jakob Ulfsson of Uppsala asked to bring along the banner of Saint Erik, which was then brought from Uppsala and installed in the priory under great festivities. In 1497, King John, King of Denmark swore his oath as monarch here before the city of Stockholm was turned over to him. However, after the great fire of 1446, the priory was unable to quite recover economically, and by 1508, it was still in a poor state.

During the Swedish War of Liberation of 1521–23, Danish-controlled Stockholm was under siege by the Swedes. The abbess of the nunnery, Anna Leuhusen, offered to allow Swedes living in Stockholm to safely escape the Danes by exiting the city through the nunnery. When they arrived at the nunnery, however, she signaled the Danish authorities, and the refugees were executed as traitors. In June 1523, Stockholm was retaken by the Swedes and made capital of the independent Kingdom of Sweden. In 1525, Elin Thomasdotter is noted to have replaced Anna Leuhusen as abbess. Foundation and Royal Patronage:

It was founded around 1286-1289 (sources vary slightly on the exact year).
The initiative and main patronage came from King Magnus Ladulås (Magnus III of Sweden). This royal connection was vital, providing land, resources, and prestige.
King Magnus Ladulås's own daughter, Princess Rikissa Magnusdotter of Sweden, entered the monastery and later became its abbess. This highlights the high status of the institution and its direct link to the royal family.
Location:

The monastery was located on the island that is now part of Norrmalm in central Stockholm. At the time of its founding, this area was just outside the main city (which was concentrated on Stadsholmen, today's Gamla Stan).
Its location was strategically chosen, and it was near the Franciscan friary (Gråbrödraklostret) which was on the nearby island of Riddarholmen. This was typical, as the Franciscan friars provided spiritual direction, Mass, and sacraments for the Poor Clare nuns.
Life of the Clarisse Nuns:

Rule of St. Clare: Their lives would have been strictly governed by the Rule of St. Clare, emphasizing:
Contemplative Prayer: The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) chanted in choir, daily Mass (celebrated by a Franciscan friar), and periods of mental prayer and meditation were the central focus.
Strict Poverty: Renunciation of all personal and communal property. While royal patronage provided the initial foundation and likely ongoing support, the ideal was to rely on alms and the work of their own hands.
Enclosure (Cloister): They lived within the walls of their monastery, with very limited contact with the outside world, to foster an atmosphere of prayer and detachment.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess (like Rikissa).
Manual Labor: This was both a spiritual discipline and a way to contribute to the community's sustenance. In the Swedish context, this would include:
Spinning wool and linen, weaving textiles.
Needlework, embroidery (perhaps for altar linens or simple vestments).
Gardening within their cloister (a challenging task given the northern climate and short growing season, but herbs and some hardy vegetables would be possible).
Baking.
Language: Liturgical Latin would be used for prayers and Mass, while their everyday spoken language would have been Old Swedish.
Significance and Role:

Spiritual Center: It was an important spiritual center for Stockholm and the kingdom, with nuns praying for the royal family, the city, and the realm.
Place for Noblewomen: Given its royal foundation and the presence of Princess Rikissa, it likely attracted daughters from Swedish noble families.
Burial Site: Important monasteries often served as burial sites for their patrons and noble families.
The Reformation and Dissolution:

The Protestant Reformation came to Sweden under King Gustav Vasa in the early 16th century.
At the Riksdag (Parliament) of Västerås in 1527, a decision was made to confiscate the property of monasteries.
Sankta Klara Kloster was dissolved. The exact year it ceased to function might have been a few years after 1527 as the process unfolded.
The nuns were dispersed; some may have returned to their families, others may have been offered the chance to marry or live in less formal religious communities if possible.
The monastery buildings and its extensive lands were confiscated by the Crown. The buildings were later repurposed and eventually demolished.
Legacy:

The current Klara Church (Sankta Klara kyrka) in Stockholm stands on or very near the site of the medieval monastery and derives its name from it, though the current church building is much later (largely 16th-18th century with later reconstructions).
The name ""Klara"" persists in the surrounding area (e.g., Klarakvarteren – the Klara quarters, Klara Sjö lake/canal).
Archaeological excavations in the Klara area have sometimes uncovered remains related to the medieval monastery.
In summary, St. Clare's Priory (Sankta Klara Kloster) in medieval Stockholm was a significant royal foundation, home to a community of Poor Clare nuns who lived a life of prayer, poverty, and enclosure. Closely linked to the Swedish royal family, it served as an important spiritual institution until its dissolution during the Protestant Reformation under Gustav Vasa.";

It was originally a Roman Catholic (Benedictine) monastery, built before 1177 and destroyed before 1293. The present monastery, which belongs to the Romanian Orthodox Church, was built near the ruins of the first monastery in the late 14th or early 15th century.

Benedictine monastery
The Benedictine[1] monastery was built for the noble Hodos kindred in Arad County in the Kingdom of Hungary.[2][3] It was first mentioned as ecclesia de Hudust in a royal charter, issued in 1177.[3] The monastery was dedicated to Saint Peter, according to a 1278 royal charter.[3] Andrew II of Hungary granted a yearly income of 1000 salt cubes to the abbot.[2][3] The last record of the monastery was made in 1278: in this year, Paul Gutkeled bequeathed the right of patronage of the monastery upon his five nephews.[2][3] The monastery seems to have been destroyed shortly thereafter, most probably during the rebellion of the Cumans, because Andrew III of Hungary donated the land known as Hudusmonostura – ""the monastery of Hodoș"" in Hungarian – to one ispán Itemus and his brothers in 1293.[3]

Orthodox monastery
The new Orthodox monastery was built near the ruins of the former abbey in the late 14th or early 15th century.[2] The present church of the monastery was built around 1370, according to a triconch plan (having apses with semi-domes on three sides of a square chamber), at a time when this architecture was spreading to Moldavia and Wallachia, the other Romanian provinces.

The Hodoș-Bodrog Monastery was also under Ottoman domination between 1552 and 1699, as part of the Eyalet of Temeşvar. The Ottoman rule was briefly interrupted for a short time by the struggle for the independence and unification of the Romanian countries, led by Michael the Brave (1595). It is likely that, during the military operations, the monastery suffered serious damages. The monastery was rebuilt at the very beginning of the 18th century, thanks to bishop Sava I Branković (oldest brother of Đorđe Branković), who resided in Lipova and later in Ineu (towns in what is now Arad County, Romania).[citation needed]

In the following decades, although continuing to suffer under the Ottoman rule, and even the hardships induced by the Transylvanian nobility, the monastery housed the residence of the bishops who shepherded this area. Among these were Sofronie, who visited Russia in 1651, and Isaija Đaković, who stayed at Hodoș-Bodrog around 1694 (he would later establish the Hodoș-Bodrog as the seat of the diocese of Ineu and Timișoara).

From the last decade of the 17th century until 1864, the monastery was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Karlowitz, Serbia and was the only contemporary Orthodox monastery of the Arad diocese that faced great difficulties.

The church underwent several restorations throughout the centuries. The original structures were altered to some extent. After the 17th-century restoration, a baroque helmet was added to the dome.

The frescoes in the monastery date from the first decades of the 17th century. Several sacred objects dating from earlier centuries add new values to the artistic treasure of the monastery, including the skull of a bull which dug up an icon of the Virgin Mary at the current site of the church.[4]

Since then the monastery has added a new church, an outdoor summer chapel, and other buildings.

Today, the monastery is within the boundaries of the Mureş Floodplain Natural Park, in the village of Bodrogu Nou (Arad County). The land and monastery are still owned by the Romanian Orthodox Church. However, in 2004 the Mureş Floodplain Natural Park was officially declared to protect and preserve the landscapes along the Mureş River. Because of the proximity of the monastery to the river, the monastery is now inside the natural park.";

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas. It is located in the village of Prnjavor, Serbia, which is about 10 km from Batočina and about 15 km from Kragujevac.

The monastery represents an immovable cultural asset as a cultural monument. [1]

History
According to legend, the monastery was built during the reign of King Stefan Dragutin at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century. Legend has it that the monastery was first built on Čukara near the spring of Mladens water. During the invasion of the Turks, the church was demolished and a new Grnčarica was built from its materials in today's hidden place.

It is more likely that the Grnčarica monastery was built in the middle of the 16th century, after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. According to the inscription above the entrance door, Grnčarica was ""created and listed"" during the time of the Turkish Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent through the efforts and efforts of Abbot Maxim and his brotherhood. The word ""created"" was also used when the church was being rebuilt after demolition or neglect.

In the Turkish census of 1739/41, the monastery was marked as the monastery of St. Nicholas near the village of Grnčarica, but it was deserted. The monastery most likely came to life again at the end of the 18th century, during the reign of the Belgrade vizier Hadži Mustafa Pasha, who was remembered for his gentle attitude towards the Serbian people, which is why he was called the ""Serbian mother"".[2]

It is not known how, but in 1835 Grnčarica was not considered a monastery, but only a parish church. With the arrival of the Defender of the Constitution, the position of Gračanica was adjusted and it again became a monastery.

Professor Josif Veselić from Kragujevac visited and described monasteries in Serbia in 1861 and 1862. Describing Grnačrica, he said that the walls were plain, rough and cracked, much damaged, painted over, but also with preserved old paintings. In the middle hung a gilded and beautifully decorated pole, like the other one in the church's vestibule. The pathos is made of brick, and the pulpit is made of white and blue marble from Studenica. The monastery had all the necessary church books with the three gospels. There are a lot of illegible inscriptions on the walls, and the one that talks about the restoration of the monastery during the time of Suleiman the Magnificent is the best read. Veselić also says that it is known for certain that the monastery was burned down in Kočina Krajina.

During the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian army ravaged the monastery, burned the archive and took away three bells. The monastery suffered the same fate during the Second World War. The Germans exiled the monks, the monastery quarters and set fire to the monastery. After the war, in 1946, Abbess Efrosini came to the abandoned and destroyed monastery with four nuns from the Monastery of Saint Petka in Izvor near Paraćin. Since then Grnčarica became a women's monastery.[3]

Architecture
The monastery church has a triconchal base, vaulted with a semi-shaped vault with a slender octagonal dome above the central space. The altar apse and side conchs are semicircular on the outside and inside. To the west is a massive square belfry with four bifores. The facades are without decorative ornamentation. The roof is pitched and covered with galvanized sheet.

The painting is the work of Valerijan (Stefanović), the first Bishop of Šumadija, who painted it in the second half of the 20th century.[4]";

Around 1290, the construction of a wooden monastery and church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was completed. At the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, the monastery of the Poor Clares was built next to the Minorite convent. In the 15th century, a brick church with a tower and an oratory for Poor Clares were erected, connected with the brick monastery. The 1613 fire of Gniezno saw the monastery and church burned down, which had to be rebuilt from scratch. The religious paintings that hang in the church are dated to the 17th century and have been attributed to various miraculous healings!;

Historical Context:

Trzebnica Abbey was founded in 1202/1203 by Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia and his wife, St. Hedwig of Andechs (who later entered the convent herself and died there). It was the first convent for women in Silesia and a very important religious and cultural center.
Silesia, including Trzebnica, came under Bohemian, then Habsburg Austrian rule, and eventually became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the Silesian Wars in the mid-18th century.
Prussian Secularization of 1810:

The year 1810 is a key date for the secularization of monastic property in Prussia.
Influenced by the Enlightenment and the financial pressures of the Napoleonic Wars (Prussia had been defeated by Napoleon), King Frederick William III of Prussia issued an edict on October 30, 1810, that ordered the dissolution of monasteries and the confiscation of their property by the state.
This edict applied to Catholic monasteries in Prussian territories, including Silesia.
Fate of Trzebnica Abbey:

Trzebnica Abbey, despite its long and distinguished history and its connection to St. Hedwig (a significant saint for the region), was secularized under this 1810 edict.
The Cistercian nuns were forced to leave, and the abbey's extensive properties were taken over by the Prussian state.
Parts of the abbey complex were later used for various purposes, including a hospital. The main church, being a significant pilgrimage site for St. Hedwig, continued to function as a parish church.";FAUX

Female branches were always rare; Norwich is the sole well-documented English example, yet a handful of continental “Sisters of Penance” are attested. The lists below include communities for which there is at least one secure medieval document (charter, testament, episcopal register, or papal letter). “♂” = male, “♀” = female, “♂/♀” = both branches next to each other.";

Jana Jerozolimskiego za murami) is a Roman Catholic parish church in the city of Poznań in western Poland. The original church on this site was built at the end of the 11th century, making it one of the oldest churches within the present boundaries of Poznań.

It stands on the south-eastern corner of the Rondo Śródka roundabout, between the neighbourhoods of Śródka and Komandoria, within the city's Nowe Miasto district. It is close to the north-west corner of Lake Malta. The epithet ""Outside the Walls"" refers to the fact that it lay outside Poznań's medieval defensive walls.

The church is dedicated to St. John of Jerusalem (John the Baptist), the patron saint of the Knights Hospitallers, to whom the church belonged until 1832 (and to whom it has now been restored).

History
A church, dedicated to St. Michael, stood on the site near the fork of the roads leading to Śrem and Giecz at the end of the 11th century. According to Jan Długosz, on 6 May 1170 Duke Mieszko III and the bishop of Poznań set up a pilgrims' hospice there. In 1187 the church and hospice were granted to the Order of the Knights Hospitallers. Around the beginning of the 13th century the Order began construction of a new church, which is essentially the building which survives to this day. It was one of the first brick-built churches in Poland. At some point before 1288 the church was re-dedicated to the Order's patron saint, St. John of Jerusalem (John the Baptist), although the older name was still sometimes used as least until 1360. The Order was also granted land to the east and south of the church, now occupied by the Komandoria district and Lake Malta. Both these names are connected with the Hospitallers: komandoria means a commandry of that Order, while the island of Malta was once the Order's home.

Following fire damage in the late 15th century the church was rebuilt in Gothic style. Around 1512 an aisle, a tower and a timber ceiling were added. In 1736 a Baroque chapel was added on the south side. In 1832 the Prussian government abolished the Order, and the church became a parish church. During the Second World War it was used for storage, and it was damaged during the Battle of Poznań in 1945. It was restored in 1948, with attempts to restore the original Romanesque architectural style.

In 1992 the church was returned to the Order of Knights Hospitallers (the parish provost is also the chaplain of the Order). The Order has opened an ambulatory care centre for cancer patients there.

Description of the building
The church has buttressed walls, two naves and a pitched roof. The tower, only slightly higher than the nave, has an asymmetric roof. The Baroque chapel on the east side (Holy Cross Chapel, kaplica Śwętego Krzyża) has a cupola with a lantern.

The oldest, Romanesque, walls are built in Flemish bond. The Romanesque western portal has two columns: that on the left dates from the 11th century (it stands ""upside down"", with its base upwards), while the right-hand column is a reconstruction. Above the portal is a figure of John the Baptist. On the same wall is a Romanesque rosetta window. An original Romanesque window can also be seen on the eastern wall of the chancel (it became visible after a more modern vestry was demolished). The church is topped with a Maltese cross.

The remains of an old church cemetery can be found within the walls surrounding the church.

Interior
Both naves have a stellar vault from the late Gothic period. The chancel has a late Romaesque cruciform vault. The vaults display frescos painted in 1949 by Stanisław Teisseyre.

The chancel has a late Gothic triptych made in a local workshop around 1520, and significantly restored after sustaining damage in the Second World War. It shows the sacra conversazione between the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist and Saint Stanisław. With the wings closed it shows the martyrdom of St. Stanisław and the beheading of John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist.

Another altar can be found in the aisle. In its centre is a picture of the mourning of Christ, many times repainted.

In Holy Cross Chapel is a Baroque altar from 1737. In its centre is a crucifix from the mid-17th century, once standing on the road to Śródka, and regarded as miraculous. It is normally covered by a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. At the sides are figures of John the Baptist and St. Stanisław. Beneath the chapel is a crypt in which two Hospitaller commanders are buried: Michał Stanisław Dąbrowski (died 1740) and Andrzej Marcin Miaskowski (died 1832).

A sandstone font stands in the aisle, dating from 1522. It is decorated with tracery and a picture of the Baptism in the Jordan, made in 1615.

At the western end of the nave is a 19th-century choir, above which is a neo-Gothic organ front made in 1948.";

Gornjak Monastery;Serbian Orthodox;0;Saint Michael Archangel;1380;2025;645;Ottoman rule;Serbia;SRB;Petrovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina;44,47838;16,52541;Male;;;Byzantine;personal research NY;;"Gornjak Monastery is a significant Serbian Orthodox monastery with a strong connection to the medieval period.

Here's a breakdown:

Location: It is located in the beautiful, rugged gorge of the Mlava River, near Petrovac na Mlavi, in eastern Serbia.
Period: It was founded in the late 14th century, specifically between 1376 and 1380, by Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, who was the Serbian ruler at the time and led the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo. This makes it a royal foundation from the immediate pre-Kosovo era.
Architectural Style: The main church (dedicated to the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as Vavedenje) belongs to the Morava architectural school. It features a trefoil (or cloverleaf) base plan and domes. While not as elaborately decorated with stone carving as some later Morava churches like Ravanica or Ljubostinja, it reflects the style of the period.
Historical Significance:
Royal Foundation: As a foundation of Prince Lazar, Gornjak held special status and was well-endowed.
Center of Hesychasm: This is one of Gornjak's most important medieval characteristics. It became a significant center for the spiritual movement of Hesychasm in the Balkans. Monks following this tradition, many of whom came from Mount Athos, sought solitude and dedicated themselves to intense spiritual prayer and contemplation. The monastery was closely associated with disciples of Saint Gregory of Sinai, particularly Saint Romylos of Vidin, who lived and was buried there.
Strategic Location: Its location in the Mlava gorge also likely had strategic importance.
Activities in medieval times:

Given its status as a royal foundation and a Hesychast center:

Intense Spiritual and Liturgical Life: The core activity was the strict monastic routine, including daily prayer, divine services, fasting, and asceticism. As a Hesychast center, there would have been a particular emphasis on individual spiritual practice, silence, and contemplation.
Hesychast Teachings and Practice: Gornjak was a place where Hesychast philosophy and practices were studied, lived out, and potentially taught to new monks. It attracted spiritual seekers dedicated to this path.
Cultural Activities:
Scriptorium: As a royal monastery and a spiritual center, it would have had a scriptorium for copying religious texts, liturgical books, theological works (especially those related to Hesychasm), and potentially chronicles.
Fresco Painting: The church was adorned with frescoes, although much of the original medieval painting has been lost or damaged over centuries.
Repository of Knowledge: It housed religious books and documents, serving as a repository of spiritual and historical knowledge.
Economic Unit: Endowed by Prince Lazar, the monastery managed land and resources to support the community and its activities.
Political Connection: Its link to Prince Lazar meant it was connected to the ruling power, receiving support and potentially offering spiritual counsel.
In summary, Gornjak Monastery was a genuinely medieval Serbian Orthodox monastery, founded by Prince Lazar in the late 14th century. It was a key center of the Morava architectural school in its region and, crucially, a significant hub for the spiritual movement of Hesychasm, attracting dedicated ascetics and serving as a place of intense spiritual life and cultural activity linked to the Serbian ruler of the time.";

A holy woman by the name of Anna Khuelberinn founded a small cloister by this chapel (Schimmer 385). The other founding members of the convent were three noble women from the dukedom of KÃ¤rnten (Wiedemann 53). As the Mother Superior Susanna explained during the 1544 visitation, the community was first viewed as a â€œBÃ¼rgerhaus,â€ or community center, for young and widowed women (Wiedemann 53). In other words, it was Beguines that were the first inhabitants of S.

The enclosure of the nuns was protected by a wall to the left of the church (Schimmer 388). A city plan from 1552 describes the Gothic style of the building. The convent building stood free, unconnected to other structures, and was bordered by four square courtyards (Wiedemann 69). ; Many important documents and books associated with the convent were lost in the great fire of April 21, 1627 (73). The conventâ€™s last leader, Maria Katharina Neubeck, took a wooden figure of St Jakob with her when she left the convent; it was held for some time by the Ursulinenkloster, and came to the Dom- and Diocesan museum in 1960.

Agnes, Himmelspforte, HimmelspfÃ¶rte, Porta Coeli Vindobonae ; Himmelpforte was founded by Constance (Konstanzia) of Bohemia (1180-1240), daughter of King Bela III of Hungary and sister of Kings Emerich and Andreas II. Her engagement to Friedrich von Schwaben cut short by his death, she married Ottokar I, King of Bohemia, with whom she had twelve children. S. Elisabeth of Hungary was her niece. Other royal relatives were similarly pious â€“ Constanceâ€™s father, Bela III, founded many churches and brought the Cistercian order to Hungary. With the passing of her husband in 1230, the royal widow moved to Vienna to live with other holy women. This group, formed between 1131 and 1140, led reclusive lives filled with meditation and other holy practices (Zak 143). Due to political tensions between her nephew Bela IV and Austrian Duke Friedrich II, Constance ultimately returned to Hungary, where she died on December 3, 1240 (144). ; During the height of the conventâ€™s existance, neighboring houses were often addressed as â€œbei der Himmelpforte,â€ or â€œby the Himmelpforteâ€ (Zak 210). ; Wien: Himmelspforten SS. Catharina et Agnes,Â Historisches Lexikon Wien in 5 BÃ¤nden,Â Himmelpfortkloster,Â HimmelpfÃ¶rtnerin,Â Wien seit sechs Jahrhunderten; eine chronologische Reihenfolge von Thatsachen, Begebenheiten und Vorfaellen in Wien von 1200 bis auf die neuere Zeit,Â Das Frauenkloster Himmelpforte in Wien ; According to Viennese legend, c. 1300 a Sister Maria was so enraptured by a handsome young knight that she fled the Himmelpforte convent and lived in the secular world for seven years, leaving her keys by the Marian picture that she had been charged with guarding. Realizing the error of her ways, the prodigal nun returned to her cloister to her comradesâ€™ surprise, for they had not missed her â€“ during her years of absense, the Virgin Mary herself had filled her shoes (Schimmer 382). The head of the convent reported the miracle to the pope, who declared that the convent should be thusly named in dedication to â€œHeavenâ€™s Gatekeepers.â€ This story is so firmly embedded in Viennese culture that it is the basis of many traditional songs and artworks and has been printed in various literature and lore collections throughout the subsequent centuries (Zak 140). (A more spun-out and dramatic version of the story is available in Schimmer.) ; The convent originally answered to the abbot of Geras, though the abbot had a looser relationship with Himmelpforte than he did with the Frauenkloster Pernegg, another womenâ€™s house under his jurisdiction (Zak 159). In 1491, by request of Emperor Friedrich III., Pope Innocence VIII. transferred control of the house to the archdiocese of Vienna: the archbishop was to appoint one or two capable and learned priests as the new spiritual leadership of Himmelpforte (217). Within the cloister, leadership was provided by an elected mistress or prioress, who managed many of the communal assets directly. ; For a time in 1529, the Himmelpforte sisters tended to sick and poor citizens displaced from the city hospital by the threat of Turkish occupation (Schimmer 382-383). ; In 1270, the sisters attempted to overthrow Matron Adelheid, holding an illegitimate election to replace her. Hearing of their disobedience, Bishop Peter threatened to excomunicate them. The nuns backed down, recognizing Adelheid as their true leader and agreeing to do penance for their misconduct. ; Augustinian, specifically Premonstratensian (c. 1270); later Augustinian Canonesses. Pope Clement IV instated the house in a Breve; Master Gerhard and Bishop Peter oversaw the sistersâ€™ continued adherence to the rule (150). Zak cites a July 1267 documen ; The population of Himmelpforte comprised lay sisters, choir sisters, and novices. The sisters were referred to by the locals as HimmelpfÃ¶rtnerinnen (Zak 140). ; According to records written by Master Gerhard, the population of the convent was never to exceed 25 (Zak 151). The convent was first founded for 12 nuns, but only 11 were in the convent at the time of the 1543-1544 visitation; the 12th was in Prague. ; Nothing remains of the convent, as the building was demolished long ago to make room for modern housing. The name of the street â€œHimmelpfortgasseâ€ is the only physical on-site indication of the old convent grounds. ; Himmelpforte stood at the corner of Himmelpfortgasse and Rauhensteingasse. ; On October 26, 1519, Archduke Ernst directed Bishop Johann Kaspar and the convent council to conduct a Himmelpforte visitation (Zak 109). ; A fire in 1318 lead to the building of a new church dedicated to St Agnes (Czeike 192); this church was consecrated on August 11, 1331 by St. Dietrich, Bishop of the Church of Dyonisin. The church was dedicated to S. Agnes and Katharina (Zak 166). A couple decades later under Mistress Katharina, the church was expanded through the addition of a chapel. Due to the dedication of its altar, it was often referred to as the Katharina chapel (178). ; Artwork and songs depicted the legend of the Virgin Maryâ€™s miraculous substitution for Sister Maria (described above in â€œNotable Membersâ€). The original image of Mary, known as the â€œHausmutter,â€ can now be found in the Eligius Chapel at the Cathedral of St. Stephan. ; As was common practice with many medieval monastic institutions, the Himmelpforte sisters often accepted gifts of money, land and goods in exchange for prayer, Masses, feast days, and other such services. Many of the extant documents recording these exchanges are notable in that they often name who possession of the property should pass to if the convent fails to meet the specified terms. In several cases, the secondary property recipient is the Viennese citizenâ€™s hospital. ; Nothing remains of the convent, as the building was demolished long ago to make room for modern housing. ; S.

• Earliest reference 1383 in a German papal tax roll: “Beguinae Mantellatae Ordinis Servorum Sanctae Mariae”.
• Disappeared after the Reformation. Typical activities of medieval Servite Mantellate (women of the Third Order of the Servants of Mary, 13th-15th c.)

A. SPIRITUAL & LITURGICAL LIFE  
• Daily attendance at Mass and at least part of the Divine Office in the neighboring Servite friary.  
• Special Marian devotions: Seven Sorrows rosary, singing or reciting the Stabat Mater, Friday fast on bread-and-water “in compassione Dominae nostrae”.  
• Saturday gathering to pray the Little Office of the Virgin as a group.  
• Frequent reception of the sacraments and monthly conferences with a Servite friar-director.  
• All-night vigils in Holy Week or on the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (15 Sept.).  
• Participation—often bare-foot—in public processions organized by the friars (especially Rogation days and Marian feasts).

B. CORPORAL WORKS OF MERCY  
1. Nursing and hospital service  
   – Regular shifts in civic or confraternal hospitals (e.g., Misericordia of Perugia; Santa Maria Nuova, Florence).  
   – Special corps for plague care: Bologna 1348, Faenza 1438, Siena 1456.  
   – Preparing simples and unguents; washing bed-linen.  
2. Feeding the hungry  
   – Bread benches (mensa panis) outside their houses; communal grain subsidies recorded in Perugia, Florence, Lucca.  
   – Soup kitchens on Fridays in Lent; distribution of dried figs or chestnuts to poor children.  
3. Clothing and burial of the poor  
   – Sewing of mantles and shifts from donated cloth; making scapulars for confraternity members.  
   – Washing, shrouding and burying plague victims when no one else would perform the task (Faenza statutes 1438, c. 7).  
4. Hospitality to pilgrims & travellers  
   – Tiny xenodochia (guest chambers) attached to the Servite precinct; free lodging limited to one night with bread and wine.  
   – Dalmatian house on the island of Krk maintained a maritime shelter for shipwrecked sailors.

C. SOCIAL & CHARITABLE PROJECTS  
• Dowry funds for poor girls (Ferrara 1470, Lucca 1491).  
• Ransom fund for citizens captured in border skirmishes (documented Lucca 1373, Orvieto 1384).  
• Small interest-free loans to widows (Florence Pia Casa delle Mantellate, statute of 1412).  
• Foundlings and orphan care: Venice Mantellate ran a scuola dei bambini mendicanti next to SS. Giovanni e Paolo.

D. MANUAL & ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES  
• Spinning, weaving and embroidery of altar linens, corporals, processional banners.  
• Cultivation of herb-gardens for hospital pharmacopeia.  
• In urban centres some kept small shops (e.g., Benvenuta of Siena sold candles; Mantellate of Viterbo ran a cloth-stall) whose profits financed alms.

E. EDUCATION & CATECHESIS  
• Basic reading and religious instruction for girls who hoped to become Mantellate or enter other tertiaries.  
• Story-telling and singing of laude spirituali for children in parish churches on vigils of feasts.  
• Copying of devotional booklets (breviaries, rosary tracts) when literate members were available.

F. COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE & DISCIPLINE  
• Elected prioress (priora) and bursar (cameraria); admitted new sisters after a year’s novitiate.  
• Simple rule: poverty in dress, silence at meals, Friday abstinence, obedience to Servite prior provincial.  
• Each sister retained her own property but submitted an annual account and tithed a portion to common works.  
• Weekly chapter of faults; corporal penances rare—usually additional fasting or hospital hours.

G. INTERACTION WITH TOWN AUTHORITIES  
• Civic magistrates often subsidised their bread or hospital work and granted tax exemptions.  
• Called on as mediators in neighbourhood disputes because they moved easily between noble, clerical and artisan circles.  
• During sieges or factional violence (e.g., Orvieto 1364) they nursed wounded soldiers irrespective of party, giving them a reputation as neutral peace-brokers.

• Spread Servite Marian piety beyond Italy; travelling merchants or pilgrims reported the example of Mantellate to Dalmatia, Austria and Bavaria.  
• Supplied scapulars and little wooden chaplets of the Seven Sorrows that became popular lay sacramentals in the 14th-15th c.

In short, the Mantellate blended intense interior devotion to the Virgin of Sorrows with hands-on social work: hospitals, hunger relief, burial of the dead, dowries and education—all while remaining lay women who lived either in their own homes or in small hospices under the guidance of Servite friars.";

First mentioned in records in 1055, Castle Mailberg (in German: Schloss Mailberg) is owned and run by the Austrian Grand Priory of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta since 1146. It is known for its wine production and now serves as a castle hotel and as Vinothek for the local Winemakers Community ""Mailberg Valley"".[3] Mailberg was first mentioned in records in 1055. Since 1146 the castle Mailberg has been in constant possession of the ‘Souveränen Malteser Ritter-Ordens’ (Sovereign Order of Malta) and hence is their oldest property worldwide. In terms of its function as commandery, the castle had served as spiritual and (for some time) as military centre through the centuries.

Eventful history
Mailberg’s eventful history is shaped by wars, which again and again severely affected the castle. Mailberg was occupied and destroyed several times during the Hussite Wars in the 15th century and during the Thirty Years‘ War (1618-1648).

In the 19th century the Napoleonic Wars also affected the wine village. In 1945 the last front line ran only 10 km south of Mailberg. Especially the Russians left their traces.

Significant role
In the history of Lower Austria the “Mailberger Bund“ played a significant role. The confederation was formed in the castle Mailberg in 1451 and was rated as the first successful corporate confederationagainst the power of the emperor.";

Wiener Gemeindebezirk Innere Stadt.

The first church on this site is mentioned in 1217, as a ""House of the Prueder of the Order of Saint John"", a commandry to care and support crusaders. The current building was built in the mid 15th century. In the 17th century it was a favoured preaching location for Abraham a Sancta Clara. This building was rebuilt to fit contemporary taste in the Baroque era and in 1806, and the Kommendenhaus (1839) and parts of the church (1857) had stained glass added during the 19th century. The Order ran into financial trouble after the First World War and in 1933 had to sell the church and the Johanneshof, and the church was given over to other uses within a historical preservation order. It was bought back in 1960 and restored in stages in 1968, 1972 and 1983–84, finishing with a general restoration in 1998.

The church's high altarpiece was painted in 1730 by Johann Georg Schmidt. The balcony type Empire marble pulpit was built during the 1806-08 reconstruction; it is decorated with a Maltese cross, a dove and gilt rosettes.";

It was placed under the authority of the Alvastra Abbey: no member of the abbey was allowed to go outside the walls without a permit from the Abbot of Alvastra, not even the abbess herself, though she could receive guests in the abbey.[2] [3]

Askeby Abbey did not belong to the largest of the Swedish nunneries, but it was wealthy and of some importance and often benefited by important people. Placed by the important road to Söderköping, it functioned as an inn for travelers. The abbey had the income from one third of the crown taxed fishing in Norrköping. The abbess of the abbey also had the right to appoint the priest of Sankt Olai kyrka at Norrköping in Östergötland which often caused conflicts with that city. In 1462, the Abbess Anna Jacobi and the nuns were given an official thanks from the Pope after their assistance to his envoy Martinus de Fregano, who had visited Sweden to gather funds for a crusade against the Ottoman Turks.

In the late 15th century the discipline was lax; the abbess received guests in her personal chambers, and in 1490 the nuns were threatened with interdict for socializing with the outside world. After the Swedish Reformation of 1527, the valuables of the abbey were confiscated and taken to the royal treasury in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, and the management of the abbey was given to the abbess of Vreta Abbey. In 1529, all remaining members of the abbey were relocated to Vreta Abbey and Askeby Abbey was thereby dissolved. The buildings burnt down eight years later. The remains of the abbey are gone.";

The architecture of the abbey shows Roman, Lombard, and Norman influences. The complex lies within the Parco Archeologico (""archaeological park"") of Venosa, approximately 1.5 km north-east of the town; it falls under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Melfi-Rapolla-Venosa. It consists of the old church, of uncertain date; the monastery buildings; and the Incompiuta, the unfinished or new church, begun in the last quarter of the eleventh century and never completed. The complex was declared a National Monument by Royal Decree on 20 November 1897.[1] It is no longer a monastery, but is used by the Trinitarian Order.[2]: 67 

History
The date of construction of the monastery is unknown; some elements may date from the eighth century.[3] A foundation date of 954 AD is documented in the spurious Chronicon Cavense of the forger, scholar and priest Francesco Maria Pratilli (1689–1763).[4] Following the Council of Melfi in 1059, the church was transformed from a cathedral to an abbey by a bull of Pope Nicholas II, and the number of monks increased from 20 to 100. In the same year he invested Robert Guiscard as Duke of Puglia and Calabria, and Guiscard made the abbey the religious centre of his domain.[2]: 73 

The old church stands on the site of an Imperial Roman building, probably a domus, which shows traces both of earlier Republican occupation and of later Late Classical modification. Some walls of the church are built directly on the mosaic floors of the earlier structure.[5]

To the south of the church and oriented at right-angles to it are the remains of an early Christian basilica, probably built in the late fifth or early sixth century, with a hexagonal font in a trefoil apse.[5]: 140 

Old church
The Romanesque entrance to the church is flanked by a pair of stone lions. The church is laid out on a typical early Christian basilica plan, with a narthex and atrium, a wide central nave and lateral aisles, transept and semi-circular apse with ambulatory.[3] Alterations were made by the Lombards in the 10th century,[citation needed] and by the Normans between the 11th and 13th centuries. Two Corinthian columns stand in the nave.

In the right aisle is the Hauteville Tomb (Italian: La tomba degli Altavilla), in which five members of the Norman Hauteville family are buried: Guglielmo Braccio di Ferro (""William Iron Arm"", 1010–1046), his brothers Drogo (c. 1010 – 1051) and Umfredo (Humphrey, c. 1010 – 1057), and their half-brothers Robert Guiscard (c. 1015 – 1085) and Guglielmo (William, c. 1027 – 1080). Their bones, previously buried separately, were gathered into a single monument in the mid-16th century by Agostino Gorizio Barba da Novara, bailiff of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem.[6]

In the left aisle is the tomb of Aberada or Alberada of Buonalbergo, who married Robert Guiscard in 1053 but was repudiated by him for the Lombard princess Sichelgaita of Salerno. Aberada's son by Guiscard, Bohemond I of Antioch, hero of the First Crusade, died in Bari in 1111 and buried in Canosa di Puglia. The inscription on her tomb reads:

GVISCARDI CONIVX ABERADA HAC CONDITVR ARCA
SI GENITVM QVÆRES HVNC CANVSINVS HABET

or roughly: ""Aberada wife of Guiscard lies in this sepulchre; if you seek her son, Canosa has him"".

Construction of L'Incompiuta began in the last quarter of the 11th century.[7] Use was made of materials from monuments of various civilizations, including the Roman, Lombard and Jewish. The layout is unusual for Italy, and French in conception; it shows similarities to that of the cathedrals of Aversa and Acerenza.[7]

In 1297, by order of Pope Boniface VIII, the abbey passed from the Benedictines into the hands of the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, at that time based in the Kingdom of Cyprus.[2]: 78 ";

The arrival of these three orders in Vrana and their cultural and political influence was conditioned by the medieval circumstances in Croatia and by the Roman Pope. Vrana had become one of the most important centers of political life, especially in the period from 1070.

After the pope's deputies crowned him as the king of Croatia, King Zvonimir Dmitar in 1076 donated the city of Vrana and Benedictine monastery of St. Gregory, as a sign of loyalty to Pope Gregory VII. Vrana was the first permanent diplomatic headquarters of the pope's deputies in the entire Slavic region. Insignia of Croatian Kingdom were held within Vrana's walls for a long time. Consequently, Coloman of Hungary in 1102 came to the coronation in Biograd, as the nearest royal residence.

In the 12th century, the church Priory of Vrana donated this property to Knights Templar. At that time, Vrana was fortified with walls and towers and a moat. There are assumptions that the present ruins of a fortified facility above the village were part of a fortified town with a church. After Knights Templars, Vrana was the property of the Knights Hospitallers from 1312.

The Ottoman Empire conquered Vrana in 1527, and it remained under their control for a century, before the Republic of Venice took it in the Candian War briefly in 1647 and Morean War finally.[5] In October 1683, the population of Venetian Dalmatia, principally Uskoks of Ravni kotari, took arms and together with the rayah (lower class) of the Ottoman frontier regions rose up, taking Skradin, Karin, Vrana, Benkovac and Obrovac.[6]

The Benedictine monastery in Vrana kept the crown of Croatian kings.

According to legend, the Croatian Knights Templar buried the great treasure in Vrana.

John of Palisna was a 14th-century prior of Vrana.

Vrana was the birthplace of two famous 15th-century Croatian masters of the Renaissance: Luciano Laurana or Lucijan Vranjanin or ""Lucijan the builder"" and sculptor Francesco Laurana or Franjo Laurana Vranjanin.

The theologian Thomas Illyricus was born in Vrana in late 15th century.";

This supplied provisions to the Hospitaller fleet and drinking water to the island of Malta, which was ruled by the Hospitallers. This supply base was initially established in rented warehouses and other buildings, but after the 1693 Sicily earthquake a permanent base was constructed over an area of approximately 5,000 m2 (54,000 sq ft), incorporating barracks, granaries, warehouses, stables, workshops, a windmill, a bakery and a pantry.[1] The complex also included an oratory and a garden.[2]";

Riseberga was placed under the administration of Julia and Alvastra monastery. Most of the members were females, but it had a minority of male members to assist the nuns: the males, however, lived outside of the walls of the convent. Riseberga was located isolated in the wilderness, and both nuns and monks of the community are known to have occasionally lived as hermits in the area around the convent.

The Grandmaster's Palace (Maltese: Il-Palazz tal-Granmastru), officially known as The Palace (Maltese: Il-Palazz), is a palace in Valletta, Malta. It was built between the 16th and 18th centuries as the palace of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled Malta from 1530 to 1798, and was also known as the Magisterial Palace (Maltese: Palazz Maġisterjali). When the knights were expelled by Napoleonic France, it became the National Palace. During the period of British rule beginning in 1800, it was the Governor's Palace (Maltese: Palazz tal-Gvernatur).

The palace became a British royal residence with various governors representing the monarchy and the queen, and with the royal family itself. As an official royal residence it was often used by British sovereigns for major events during their stay in Malta.

The Palace currently houses the Office of the President of Malta. It was also the seat of the Parliament of Malta from 1921 to 2015. Parts of the building, namely the Palace State Rooms and the Palace Armoury are open to the public as a museum run by Heritage Malta. The building undertook a major restoration project which was then inaugurated on 12 January 2024.[1]

Location
The Grandmaster's Palace occupies a city block in the centre of Valletta, and it is the largest palace in the city.[2] Its façade is located opposite the Main Guard in St. George's Square (Maltese: Misraħ San Ġorġ) along Republic Street (Maltese: Triq ir-Repubblika).[3] The palace is also bounded by Archbishop Street (Maltese: Triq l-Arċisqof), Old Theatre Street (Maltese: Triq it-Teatru l-Antik) and Merchants Street (Maltese: Triq il-Merkanti).

History
Hospitaller rule

Corridor in the Grandmaster's Palace
When the Order of St. John established the new city of Valletta in 1566, the original intention was to build the palace of the Grand Master on high ground in the southern part of the city (on or near the site later occupied by Auberge de Castille). In fact, present-day South Street (Maltese: Triq in-Nofsinhar) was originally known as Strada del Palazzo, since the palace was meant to be built there.[4]

The site of the palace was originally occupied by several buildings, including the house of the knight Eustachio del Monte which was built in 1569,[5] and the auberge of the langue of Italy which was built in around 1571.[6] Both of these buildings were built to designs of the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar.[7]

In 1571, Grand Master Pierre de Monte moved the Order's headquarters to Valletta, and he lived in the house of Eustachio del Monte, who was his nephew. The Council of the Order subsequently purchased the house, and in 1574 it began to be enlarged into a palace for the Grand Master. By this time, del Monte had died and he was succeeded as Grand Master by Jean de la Cassière.[8] The Italian langue moved to a new auberge in 1579, and the original auberge was also incorporated into the palace.[6] The Grandmaster's Palace was built to Mannerist designs of Glormo Cassar.[7]

The palace was modified and embellished by subsequent Grand Masters, which gave the building a Baroque character. The ceilings of the main corridors were decorated with frescoes by Nicolau Nasoni in 1724, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena.[5] In the 1740s, Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca made extensive alterations to the building and gave it its present configuration. Pinto's renovations included the embellishment of the façade, the opening of a second main entrance, and the construction of a clock tower in one of the courtyards.[9]

In the 1770s, the traveller Patrick Brydone wrote that:[10]

the Grand Master (who studies conveniency more than magnificence) is more comfortably and commodiously, lodged than any prince in Europe, the King of Sardenia perhaps only excepted

Ottoman attack on the post of the Castilian knights on 21 August 1565
The knights, led by Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, withstood the Great Siege of Malta by the Ottomans in 1565.[92] The knights, with the help of Portuguese, Spanish and Maltese forces, repelled the attack.[104][105] After the siege they decided to increase Malta's fortifications, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of Valletta, named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established watchtowers along the coasts – the Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin towers – named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa (modern Birgu) and the construction of new cities including Città Rohan (modern Ħaż-Żebbuġ). However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined and the Order had become unpopular.";

In fact, present-day South Street (Maltese: Triq in-Nofsinhar) was originally known as Strada del Palazzo, since the palace was meant to be built there.[4]

The site of the palace was originally occupied by several buildings, including the house of the knight Eustachio del Monte which was built in 1569,[5] and the auberge of the langue of Italy which was built in around 1571.[6] Both of these buildings were built to designs of the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar.[7]

In 1571, Grand Master Pierre de Monte moved the Order's headquarters to Valletta, and he lived in the house of Eustachio del Monte, who was his nephew. The Council of the Order subsequently purchased the house, and in 1574 it began to be enlarged into a palace for the Grand Master. By this time, del Monte had died and he was succeeded as Grand Master by Jean de la Cassière.[8] The Italian langue moved to a new auberge in 1579, and the original auberge was also incorporated into the palace.[6] The Grandmaster's Palace was built to Mannerist designs of Glormo Cassar.[7]

The palace was modified and embellished by subsequent Grand Masters, which gave the building a Baroque character. The ceilings of the main corridors were decorated with frescoes by Nicolau Nasoni in 1724, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena.[5] In the 1740s, Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca made extensive alterations to the building and gave it its present configuration. Pinto's renovations included the embellishment of the façade, the opening of a second main entrance, and the construction of a clock tower in one of the courtyards.[9]

In the 1770s, the traveller Patrick Brydone wrote that:[10]

the Grand Master (who studies conveniency more than magnificence) is more comfortably and commodiously, lodged than any prince in Europe, the King of Sardenia perhaps only excepted";

A provost administered the community. The convent's location on a territorial border put it in the way of many damages due to warfare. The secularization of this community occurred relatively early. In 1536 the electoral prince, Joachim II, allowed Hans von Arnim to inventory the convent's holdings and conveyed these to him in 1538. A year later, he purchased the convent and all its appurtenances (land, rights, buildings, and herds) from the prince.

The survey revealed that the convent church was a single nave construction with flying butresses on the north wall and choir. The western portion was divided into an upper and lower church. In the northern part of the church were traces of a round window and a niche. The western portion of the church probably had a flat roof. Under a portion of the church existed a crypt, from which two windows in the north wall and one in the south wall remain. The cloister buttressed the church on the south wall. No east wing of the complex appears to have existed. Instead, the foundations of a long building were found on the east side. The west wing of the cloister ran in a north-south direction to the convent buildings and housed the nuns' dormitory. The south and western wing of the cloister had two stories. The convent church was a brick building with a choir that had large Gothic windows. The nave was divided into an upper and lower story, presumably a nuns' choir existed on the upper level and the conversae used the lower church. The entrance door for this lower level was located in the west wall. In the north of the choir under the windows were niches for the altar and baptismal. There was presumably a two-storied cloister that connected the nuns' dormitory with their choir. Perhaps more convent buildings were located to the south-east of the cloister. The refectory was located on the ground level of the west range, which also had Gothic windows on its southern side. The refectory was heated by means of an underground heating chamber or oven room. The chimney lay in the northern part of the refectory. The entrance to the cloister was located in the northern range of the convent ruins.

In 1431, Pope Eugene IV sent a Breve to the Generals of Minors in which he complained that, in some of the monasteries of the Clarisse sisters, they did not wear the required uniform, and that there were dissensions and scandals. He wanted the Generals to visit these monasteries, enforcing rigorous claustration, deposing the abbesses who could not enforce the rules, transferring to other monasteries the undisciplined nuns, and relying on secular authorities when necessary. The faults apparently multiplied and, in 1437, the Pope ordered that all goods were to be taken away from worthless monasteries and transferred to houses within the same order, or to churches, or to hospitals. However, these orders were not minded in Ascoli. On July 9, 1460, the nuns of S. Angelo had to transfer to S. Maria delle Donne according to the Preve of Pope Pius II. Some did not stay at S. Maria delle Donne, but were transferred to Santo Spirito e Santa Maria delle Vergini, with Benedictine rule. In 1488, Cardinal Filippo Calandrini, Bishop of Bologna and Governor of Marche issued an order that, if in any monastery both sexes are received so that one can also suspect sacrilegious relations, those guilty of it will be punished with 4 lashings of a cord and a fine of 10 gold ducats. Nothing came of this order because, as soon as the plague was over, S. Maria delle Donne renewed its licentious life.

San Giorgio “d’Alvaneto” (or “di Albaneto”) is one of the many very small, semi-eremitic monasteries that dotted the high valleys of the Sibillini/Alto-Maceratese area in the Middle Ages. The surviving fabric is today little more than a rural church a few kilometres south-west of the historic centre of San Ginesio, but thirteenth- and fourteenth-century charters kept in the Archivio di Stato di Macerata and in the Archivio Diocesano di Camerino give us a reasonably clear idea of what it was, who lived there, and what they did.

Chronology & foundation
• Probably late 11th century. The earliest explicit reference is a papal protection bull of Celestine III (8 June 1195) which lists “monasterium Sancti Georgii de Albaneto” among the possessions of the Benedictine Abbey of S. Maria di Chiaravalle di Fiastra.
• The dedication to St George and the toponym Alvaneto (or Albaneto, a medieval term for a place cleared of woodland for cultivation) are typical of Benedictine “celle” founded when the great abbeys of the Marche were pushing up into the Apennines to open new land.
• From c. 1250 to c. 1400 it is regularly named in episcopal visitations as a monasterium or prioratus with two to five professed Benedictine monks.
• After 1420 the monks disappear from the record; it becomes a grangia (agricultural estate) administered by a secular prior for the mother-abbey, and by the later 15th c. is effectively a rural parish church. Suppressed in the Napoleonic period (1808), it passed into private hands; only the church remains in use.

Correct religious order
All the documentation places San Giorgio firmly inside the Benedictine network. It is never listed among Augustinian, Camaldolese or Cistercian houses in the diocesan Libri Status; the monks call themselves “ordo Sancti Benedicti” and obey the abbots of Fiastra (who, although Cistercian, exercised the rights of a mother-house over several older Benedictine cells). In practical terms it functioned as a tiny Benedictine priory/beaterio attached to Fiastra.

Economic & social activities in the Middle Ages
Agriculture and stock-raising
• The charters speak of terre, vineae, castagneti, prati – grain, vines, chestnut groves and hay meadows. Sheep and transhumant cattle were brought up from the Chienti valley for summer pasture.
• The monks introduced modest water-management works on the Rio Alvaneto (small dams, gore and mills). A 1316 lease mentions a water-mill infra claustrum monasterii.

Hospitality
• Located on a secondary Appennine crossing (the track that later became the “strada delle Fornaci” toward Sarnano and Amandola), San Giorgio functioned as a hospitium for herdsmen and for the small but steady flow of pilgrims moving between the Adriatic ports and the Via Flaminia/Assisi–Rome corridor. A 1283 visitation notes two camere peregrinorum equipped with straw-mattressed beds.

Spiritual services
• Daily Benedictine Office plus Mass for the sparse hill population; burial concessions were granted to the nearby villae of Vallimestre and Focete in 1329.
• A single 14th-c. reference suggests the presence of a very small scriptorium (payment to scriptor domus S. Georgii pro uno psalterio pergameni), but this was certainly not a major centre of manuscript production.

Feudal / rent-taking role
• As at many Benedictine cellule, the monks collected censi (rents in kind) from colonists who had been installed to farm newly cleared land. Typical contracts gave one-third of grain and must, plus two days a year of compulsory labour (operae).

Decline
• Repeated raids during the Angevin–Visconti wars (1360s–70s) and the Black Death collapsed the resident community.
• By 1405 papal inspectors already call the place quasi desertum. In 1424 the abbot of Fiastra granted it in perpetual farm (in enfiteusi) to the noble Giorgi family of San Ginesio, on condition they keep a chaplain to say Mass three times a week – effectively ending its monastic life.

The fabric today
Romanesque single-nave church, squared limestone, semicircular apse with monolithic window, arch of roughly 1100–1150; a small two-room conventual block to the south, now converted into a farmhouse. Fragments of 13th-c. frescoes (a St George on horseback, an Annunciation) survive under later limewash.

In short: during the High and Late Middle Ages San Giorgio d’Alvaneto was a very small Benedictine cell dependent on the great Cistercian-Benedictine Abbey of Fiastra, devoted above all to reclaiming and farming the upland terrain and giving basic pastoral care and hospitality. It never passed to other orders, and its monastic life ended in the early 15th century, after which it survived only as a rural church and grange.";FAUX

The most well-known ""Amadeans"" (or Amadeites) were a reformed branch of the Franciscans, founded by the Blessed Amadeus of Portugal (Amadeo Menez da Silva, c. 1420–1482). Their key period of activity was in the latter half of the 15th century.
Problem: Your foundation date of 1370 predates Blessed Amadeus of Portugal by about 50 years, and his reform movement by even more.
Possible Interpretations:
Not the Franciscan Amadeans: It's highly unlikely this refers to the later Franciscan Amadean reform.
A Local ""Amadea"": The name ""S. Amadea"" and ""Amadean"" might refer to a community founded by, or dedicated to, a local figure named Amadea. She might have been a pious noblewoman, the foundress, or an early benefactor who inspired the community.
A Misattribution or Data Anomaly: There's a possibility the ""Amadean"" label is an error or refers to something very specific and obscure.
Patron Saint: ""Saint Amadea"":

There isn't a widely recognized or formally canonized ""Saint Amadea"" prominent enough to have an order or multiple monasteries named after her in the 14th century.
This strongly suggests that if ""Saint Amadea"" is accurate as the patron, she was likely a figure of local veneration (perhaps the foundress herself, who was considered saintly by the community and local people) or the house was simply known informally by the name of its foundress/key figure, Amadea, who might not have been formally a saint.
It could also be that the house was formally dedicated to a more common saint (e.g., St. Mary, St. Clare, St. Augustine), but was colloquially known as ""S. Amadea"" after its foundress or a significant benefactor.
Period: 1370-1431 (Late Middle Ages):

This period was tumultuous for the Church:
The Avignon Papacy ended in 1377.
The Great Western Schism (1378-1417) saw multiple papal claimants.
There was a strong desire for ""Papal/Ecclesiastic Reform,"" as your data notes. This led to many new foundations, often emphasizing stricter observance, poverty, or a return to perceived original ideals.
In Italy, this era saw the flourishing of many smaller, often independent communities of pious women (and sometimes men), living under various rules (Augustinian, Benedictine, Franciscan Third Order Regular, or locally adapted statutes).
Location: Cingoli, Italy:

Cingoli is a town in the Marche region of central Italy. This area was part of the Papal States, though often with considerable local autonomy. It had a rich religious life.
Type of Community:

Given the context, ""S. Amadea"" was almost certainly a community of religious women (a nunnery or a convent).
They would have lived a communal life dedicated to prayer, religious observance, and likely some form of work compatible with their enclosure or status (e.g., needlework, teaching, caring for liturgical items, gardening if enclosed).
The ""reform"" aspect might mean they adopted a stricter interpretation of an existing rule (e.g., Augustinian, Benedictine) or aimed for a life of greater poverty and devotion.
Reason for Foundation: ""Papal/Ecclesiastic Reform"":

A local noblewoman (perhaps this Amadea) or a group of pious women might have sought to establish a community dedicated to a more fervent religious life, responding to the widespread calls for reform and spiritual renewal. This could have been supported by the local bishop or even have papal encouragement if it aligned with reform efforts.
Lifespan: 61 years (1370-1431):

This is a relatively short lifespan for a monastic foundation.
Reasons for its end could include:
Lack of vocations.
Insufficient financial resources or loss of patronage.
Difficulties arising from the Great Western Schism (e.g., divided loyalties, instability).
Suppression or amalgamation with another, larger community by ecclesiastical authorities (common for smaller houses).
The death of its foundress or key leader (Amadea?), leading to a decline.
In summary for S. Amadea in Cingoli (1370-1431):

This was likely a small community of religious women (a nunnery or convent) founded in Cingoli during a period of intense desire for ecclesiastical reform. The name ""S. Amadea"" and the term ""Amadean"" almost certainly refer to a foundress or key local figure named Amadea, rather than the later Franciscan Amadean reform movement or a widely recognized saint.

This community would have pursued a life of prayer and religious observance, possibly with a focus on stricter adherence to a rule, in response to the reformist currents of the time. Its relatively short existence of 61 years suggests it may have faced challenges common to many smaller, local foundations in a turbulent era, eventually leading to its cessation in 1431.

To find more specific details, one would likely need to consult local histories of Cingoli and the Marche region, looking for records of female monastic communities from that period.";FAUX

Established by Benedictine monks about 1070, it ranks among the most important Romanesque buildings in the state of Carinthia. The Benedictines were succeeded by the knightly Order of Saint George in 1469 and the Society of Jesus (Jesuits, SJ) in 1598.

Until its dissolution in 1773 under Emperor Joseph II, Millstatt Abbey for centuries was the spiritual and cultural centre of Upper Carinthia and with its possessions around Millstätter See, in the Gurk Valley (Brückl) as well as in the former March of Friuli and in the Archbishopric of Salzburg (Pinzgau), one of the largest in the region.

History
Millstatt Abbey was founded as a proprietary monastery by the Chiemgau count Aribo II (1024–1102), a scion of the Aribonid dynasty and former count palatine of Bavaria, and his brother Poto, on their estates in the newly established Duchy of Carinthia. Though no charter is preserved, a later chronicle mentions a tithe agreement from about 1070 between Aribo, who then held two churches at Millstatt, and Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg. As Bishop Gebhard was exiled by King Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy in 1077, it is presumed that the foundation took place in the time period before.

Both Aribo and Poto were mentioned as founders (fundator huius ecclesie) in a 13th-century parish register. Though the foundation legend of a Carantanian duke Domitian has not been conclusively established (see below), a church may have already existed at the site since the days of Charlemagne. The monastery had definitely been established before 1122, when it was mentioned in a deed issued by Pope Callixtus II.";FAUX

Erentrude/Erentrudis was the first abbess and a relative of founder Rupert. She was of Franconian-Merovingian heritage, but despite her royal descent dedicated her life to caring for the sick and the less fortunate. Tradition claims that prior to her career at Nonnberg, she led a community of religious women at Worms; it is possible that some of these devout followed her to Salzburg (Kulzer,Â Erentrude: Nonnberg, EichstÃ¤tt, America, 51). Erentrude was also known for her pedagogy in regards to young children. Nonnberg chaplain Caesarius compared her piety and compassion to that of the Virgin Mother (GB 211). She made Psalm 73, verse 28 her motto. Her remains were moved to the crypt under the presbytery on September 4, 1023. (Esterl,Â Chronik des adeligen Benediktiner-Frauen-Stiftes Nonnberg in Salzburg, von Entstehen desselben bis zum Jahre 1840 aus dem Quellen bearbeitet, 18) Erentrudeâ€™s feast is celebrated on June 30. Until Vatican II, Nonnberg celebrated the transfer of her remains as a second feast on September 4; now, this day serves as their church dedication day. This original abbess has been honored since 1624 as the official Landesmutter, and was declared in a letter from Archbishop Karl Berg a diocese patron in 1896 (GB 212). Apparently some of the devout invoke her assistance when suffering from migraines (213). ; - Caesarius tells of a legendary dispute with Brother Albert of St. Peter during the reign of Abbess Diemut V. von Velben (1266-1270). The monk had apparently drawn a saltmine boundary to Nonnbergâ€™s disadvantage. The night before the hearing, the abbess and an elder sister held prayerful vigil at the grave of S. Erentrudis. When it came time for Brother Albert to swear before the Archbishop the next day, he fell over dead.

Prayer (as above): The central focus.
Manual Labor:
Textile Work: Spinning wool or flax, weaving cloth for their habits and simple items. Rieti had a tradition of textile production.
Needlework/Embroidery: Mending, making altar linens. Perhaps some finer work if commissioned, but always within the bounds of poverty.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for vegetables, herbs (for food and simple medicines).
Baking: Bread for their own sustenance.
General Upkeep: Cleaning and maintaining their monastic home.
Spiritual Reading & Study: Reading the Scriptures, writings of the Church Fathers, lives of saints, and the Rule itself. Literacy would vary, but some was necessary for the choir nuns.
Chapter Meetings: For community business, spiritual exhortation from the Abbess, and the ""chapter of faults.""
Relationship with the City of Rieti:

Spiritual Benefactors: The nuns were seen as a source of spiritual strength for Rieti, interceding for the city and its people.
Dependence on Alms: They relied on the charity of Rieti's citizens. This created a bond between the monastery and the town. Local families might support the monastery, and some would send their daughters to become nuns.
Symbol of Franciscan Ideals: In a city so deeply connected to St. Francis, the Poor Clares of ""S. Chiara"" would have been a living embodiment of the Franciscan feminine ideal.

Many Danes felt that the mendicant orders, nicknamed the 'beggar monks and nuns' were an additional burden over and above the regular tithes and fees paid to sustain the church. In 1527 a priest formerly assigned to the monastery wrote to King Christian II, describing a chest which the abbess of the monastery had given him to distribute to the Poor Clares in Odense, who were suffering dire poverty. The abbess had asked him to convey the money in secret because she was afraid if the amount became known the Order would be held up to scorn and ridicule. He encouraged Christian II to return to Denmark to take in hand the care of the Poor Clares who had been his mother's 'particular and elect' daughters.;"St. Clare's Priory in Copenhagen, Denmark, was a short-lived community of nuns of the Order of Poor Clares, which lasted from 1497 to 1536. The monastic buildings then came into use as a mint, which after its decommissioning became known as the Old Mint, giving rise to the present day street name Gammel Mønt at the site.

History
The Poor Clares first arrived in Denmark in 1249. An important monastery was established at Roskilde, the capital of Denmark at the time.

In 1497 King John I and Queen Christina founded the monastery in Copenhagen with a gift of the former royal vegetable gardens, located in the north part of the city near the city wall, in an area known as Rosengård after an earlier estate.[1] In 1498 the Queen made a donation of 40 Rhenish Guilders for construction of the monastery. It was completed and consecrated on 11 August 1505, the Feast day of St. Clare, with great ceremony. The monastery consisted of a dormitory, refectory, church, infirmary, cellars and places for lay sisters and a priest to stay, Foundation and Patronage:

It was founded relatively late in the medieval period, around 1497 or 1498.
The key patrons were King Hans (John) of Denmark and his wife, Queen Christina of Saxony. Royal patronage was crucial for the establishment and initial support of such an institution. Queen Christina, in particular, was known for her piety and support for religious orders.
It was established in close proximity to the Franciscan friary (Gråbrødrekloster – Greyfriars' Monastery) in Copenhagen, which was typical, as the friars provided spiritual guidance, Mass, and sacraments for the Poor Clare nuns.
Location:

The monastery was located in the area of present-day Klareboderne street in central Copenhagen. The street name itself (""Clare's Stalls"" or ""Clare's Booths"") is a direct reminder of the monastery's presence.
Life of the Clarisse Nuns:

Rule of St. Clare: Their lives would have been governed by the Rule of St. Clare, emphasizing:
Contemplative Prayer: The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) chanted in choir, daily Mass (celebrated by a Franciscan friar), and periods of mental prayer and meditation were the core of their existence.
Strict Poverty: Renunciation of all personal and communal property, relying on alms (though royal patronage likely provided a significant initial endowment and ongoing support) and the work of their own hands.
Enclosure (Cloister): They lived within the walls of their monastery, with very limited contact with the outside world, to foster an atmosphere of prayer and detachment.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess (or Prioress, as ""Priory"" suggests).
Manual Labor: This was both a spiritual discipline and a means of contributing to the community. In an urban setting like Copenhagen, this could include:
Spinning and weaving (wool, linen).
Needlework, embroidery (e.g., for altar linens, liturgical vestments if simple).
Gardening within their cloister for herbs and some vegetables.
Baking.
Language: Liturgical Latin, with their common spoken language being Danish.
Short Lifespan:

The Sankt Clara Kloster had a relatively short existence compared to Poor Clare monasteries in Southern Europe.
The Protestant Reformation reached Denmark in the early 16th century. King Christian III officially established Lutheranism as the state religion in 1536.
As part of the Reformation, all Catholic monasteries and religious houses were dissolved. Sankt Clara Kloster was suppressed around this time (1536-1537).
After Dissolution:

The nuns would have been forced to leave. Some may have returned to their families, others might have tried to continue a religious life discreetly or married.
The monastery buildings and properties were confiscated by the Crown. The buildings were repurposed for other uses (e.g., some sources suggest parts were used for the university or as residences) before eventually being demolished.
In summary:
The Poor Clares' Priory (Sankt Clara Kloster) in medieval Copenhagen was a royal foundation established at the very end of the 15th century. The nuns lived a traditional contemplative life according to the Rule of St. Clare, supported by the Danish monarchy and in close association with the Franciscan friars. Their presence was cut short by the Protestant Reformation in 1536, leading to the dissolution of the monastery. The street name ""Klareboderne"" serves as a lasting urban memory of this community of nuns..";

Provosts were responsible for the economic mangagement of the convent. Among the farm buildings were a corn house (used for storage of grain), a bakery with a bread cellar, a brewery with malt house, a brick oven, and a water mill. Among those dependent on the convent numbered millers, cooks, malters, fishers, cattleherds, blacksmiths, laborers, maids, and scribes. They also employed an apothecary and had their own brick oven for manufacturing bricks. ; The community supported approximately 180 people, including nuns, servants, the poor and ill.";"Cenobium ad sanctum sepulchrum in Thegow, monasterium sanctimonialium in Thegow, cenobium tu den heiligen grabe ; The convent was founded as a Cistercian female house in 1287 by Margrave Otto V. According to the foundation legend, a trader from Freiburg stole liturgical objects and a consecrated host from the church in Techow. Overcome by a remorseful conscience, the trader buried these objects near the village of Galgenberg (gallow hill). While he buried the objects, the host began to bleed. The residents of Techow overtook the trader in Pritzwalk, ran him down and took him to the gallows. The consecrated host remained in Priztwalk. Sometime later, the bishop of Havelberg became very ill. On the verge of death, he asked that the host be brought to his aid. Once the bishop recovered, he returned the host to the Galgenberg. Pilgrims soon followed, including Margrave Otto V. As he sat at the table here, he witnessed the food turn into blood. That night a voice directed him to erect a female convent on that location, which he did. The convent was erected (according to the legend then) as a result of this miraculous bleeding host. More mundane motivations for the foundation of this house may have been the stabilization of Otto V's power in this region, the securing of its borders, and perhaps provision for daughters of the nobility. ; Under the leadership of Abbess Anna von Quitzow and prioress Elisabeth von Alvensleben the convent withstood the introduction of the Lutheran reform. In 1543 the convent adopted the Protestant teachings but fought the alienation of its properties that had occurred already by 1542/43 with the support of the landed nobility in the region. After years of disputes, the properties of the convent were returned to the community and were not allowed to become a part of the lords' domain. In 1549 Heiligengrabe was transformed into an evangelical women's chapter and remains as such to the present day. ; Two breviaries that belonged to this convent are located in the Zentralbibliothek (Central library) in Zurich, #Rh. 178 and 179.

The church is a single nave structure with an upper-level nuns' choir, built towards the end of the thirteenth century. The nuns'choir was original located in an upper level structure in the south side of the church and spanned the five western-most trancepts. A late Gothic chapel to the holy sepulcher, also a single nave construction, is located west of the convent church outside of the convent enclosure. The chapel was built in the brick step-Gothic style and remains extant. Work undertaken in the chapel in 1986 revealed an earlier building phase of the chapel from the early thirteenth century. The convent buildings were located north of the church and presumably enclosed the original cemetary in the middle. In contrast to many male houses, the organization of the convent buildings were determined by the location of the nuns' choir in the western end of the church; thus the most important rooms were located in the west wing. In the west wing were found the chapter house and the dormitory. The kitchen and refectory were also presumably located in the west wing. The east wing held the work rooms. The provost's house was located north-west of the cloister complex, while the area to the south of the complex was used for the agricultural buildings. Outside the convent wall were located several ponds, each with a mill beside it. Between the ponds and the provost's house was the main entrance to the convent complex.

They gained permission from the city to establish a conventual life in near-by Pilsach without adhering to a definite rule. Reportedly the community grew and had already reached the number of 45 when Count Gottfried of SulzbÃ¼rg and his wife Adelheid of Hohenfels granted land and property for the foundation of a convent in 1242 (Krausen, 89). The convent was incorporated within the Cistercian order and placed under a father-abbot from Heilsbronn. In order to instruct the women in the 'spirit' of the Cistercian order, the convent received an abbess fromÂ Maidbronn, named Fridruna (Fedran). In 1249 Bishop Heinrich IV of EichstÃ¤tt confirmed the gifts of Gottfied of SulzbÃ¼rg. In the same year King Konrad IV placed the young convent under his protection and appointed the dukes of NÃ¼rnberg as patrons and advocates for the convent (Krausen, 89-90). ; Between 1413/1429 the father abbot grew concerned with increasingly lax discipline within the convent. The convent resisted the encroachment of the Protestant Reformation. Although the convent was ordered to reform in 1556, Abbess Anna von Kuedorf and a fellow nun (the only two remaining nuns in the convent) raised such a resistance that only 20 years later could the government in Amberg dissolve the convent. After the Counter-Reformation and with the reestablishment of catholicism in the region, the convent's goods were transfered to the convent in Amberg (1667). From 1667 until its dissolution the convent belonged to the Order of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The final dissolution of the convent occurred in 1803. In 1930 the remaining cloister buildings were acquired by Cistercian monks from Bonnauch/Tauber and in 1931 the new abbey was consecrated. ; further sources?: Buchner, F. X.

Innocent made the church structure smaller, but built a monastery for sixty nuns above the church. Innocent III died in 1216 and Honorius III oversaw the completion of his predecessor's monastic complex. In 1219 St. Dominic received authorization from Honorius III to undertake the task of organizing a community within Innocent's splendid buildings. Due to the relucatance of most Roman women, it was not until 28 February 1220 that the new model monastery was inhabited by five nuns from the nearby convent of Santa Maria in Tempuli move into. The night before, their precious seventh century icon of the Blessed Virgin (now in the monastery of the successors of those sisters on Monte Mario) was carried in a procession to San Sisto from its old home of S. Maria in Tempulo. Among these first five sisters was nineteen-year-old Cecilia of Rome, who provided us with a facinating and dramatic account of the several phaseses of foundation in her biography of Saint Dominic, Miracula beati Dominici.

Under Innocent III the two aisles of the original church were totally demolished, a new floor was laid down in the nave well above the old one to bring the church into line with the then level of the valley, the walls of the nave that remained were raised, the entire structure was made smaller and a monastery for women was built over the church. ; Miracle-working icon first known as ""The Madonna of Santa Maria in Tempuli"" and, after the incorporation of the convent of Santa Maria in Tempuli into that of San Sisto, as ""The Madonna of San Sisto."" The icon was an asset that distingushed the community housing from all other Roman institutions. The miraculous icon of the Virgin, was considered a brandeum or associative relic, because it was believed to have been painted by the apostle Luke. Since the tenth century the nuns of Santa Maria in Tempuli publically processed behind the icon on the great liturgical feast days in Rome. Tradition held that Pope Sergius III had endorsed the ritual and miraculous status of the icon by processing with the image on his own shoulders. It would be hard to overestimate the prestige of this icon, which was publicized throughout Europe in sermons and miracle stories.

History
Basilian monastery

The Casa dei Cavalieri di Rodi and the Dominican convent on the site of the Forum of Augustus, by Augusto (Nolli, 1748)[1]

The Temple of Mars with the campanile of the Basilians and the Arco dei Pantani, by Piranesi, 1756 - note the name Foro di Nerva
The Forum of Augustus and Temple of Mars Ultor were probably destroyed by earthquakes in the 5th century. In the medieval era it was known by several names - the forum itself as Foro transitorio, Foro di Nerva and Foro di San Basilio, and the temple as Palatium Traiani Imperatoris (palace of emperor Trajan) or the temple of Nerva ('tempio di Nerva'). 'Foro di San Basilio' refers to the first medieval use of the Forum, the small 10th century church of San Basilio al Foro di Augusto and its adjoining Basilian monastery, built on the podium of the temple and its exedra. The walls of that complex were found during the 1930s demolition phase and dated to the 9th-10th centuries.

The Basilian church was a small oratory built into the temple's apse. It was originally intended to be used as a monastery.";

While your previous questions focused on the Clarisse (Poor Clares), a monastery dedicated to St. Lawrence would most likely have belonged to a different order, especially given its antiquity.

Here's what is generally known:

Ancient Origins: The church and associated monastic buildings of San Lorenzo in Todi are very old, with foundations possibly dating back to the early medieval period, perhaps even earlier, though the current structures reflect later Romanesque and Gothic rebuilding and modifications.
Likely Benedictine: Early and prominent monasteries like one dedicated to St. Lawrence were very often Benedictine in origin. The Benedictine order was the dominant monastic force in Western Europe for centuries before the rise of the mendicant orders (like the Franciscans and Dominicans) in the 13th century.
If it was Benedictine, it would have followed the Rule of St. Benedict.
This means a life centered around ""Ora et Labora"" (Prayer and Work).
Prayer: The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) chanted in common at set times throughout the day and night, plus daily Mass.
Work: This could include agricultural work on lands owned by the monastery, manuscript copying in a scriptorium (especially in earlier medieval times), crafts, administration of the monastery's properties, and offering hospitality.
Unlike the Poor Clares, Benedictine monasteries could own property and often became significant landowners and economic centers.
Location and Importance in Todi:
The San Lorenzo complex was situated within the city walls, indicating its integration into the urban fabric.
It would have played a role in the religious and civic life of Todi. Monasteries often served as centers of learning (if they had a school or scriptorium), charity, and spiritual guidance for the local population.
Medieval Period Activities (if Benedictine):
Liturgical Life: The monks would have maintained a full schedule of liturgical prayer.
Land Management: If they owned agricultural lands around Todi, monks (or lay brothers/serfs working for them) would have managed these.
Scriptorium (Possible): Copying religious texts, chronicles, or classical works.
Hospitality: Providing lodging for pilgrims or other travelers, as was a Benedictine tradition.
Pastoral Care: While primarily focused on their monastic life, they might have had some involvement in the spiritual care of people associated with the monastery or living nearby.
Art and Architecture: Over the centuries, the monastery and church would have been embellished with art and architectural additions, reflecting the styles of different periods.";FAUX

Servite “Mantellata” (Third-Order sister)   Typical activities of medieval Servite Mantellate (women of the Third Order of the Servants of Mary, 13th-15th c.)

A. SPIRITUAL & LITURGICAL LIFE  
• Daily attendance at Mass and at least part of the Divine Office in the neighboring Servite friary.  
• Special Marian devotions: Seven Sorrows rosary, singing or reciting the Stabat Mater, Friday fast on bread-and-water “in compassione Dominae nostrae”.  
• Saturday gathering to pray the Little Office of the Virgin as a group.  
• Frequent reception of the sacraments and monthly conferences with a Servite friar-director.  
• All-night vigils in Holy Week or on the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (15 Sept.).  
• Participation—often bare-foot—in public processions organized by the friars (especially Rogation days and Marian feasts).

B. CORPORAL WORKS OF MERCY  
1. Nursing and hospital service  
   – Regular shifts in civic or confraternal hospitals (e.g., Misericordia of Perugia; Santa Maria Nuova, Florence).  
   – Special corps for plague care: Bologna 1348, Faenza 1438, Siena 1456.  
   – Preparing simples and unguents; washing bed-linen.  
2. Feeding the hungry  
   – Bread benches (mensa panis) outside their houses; communal grain subsidies recorded in Perugia, Florence, Lucca.  
   – Soup kitchens on Fridays in Lent; distribution of dried figs or chestnuts to poor children.  
3. Clothing and burial of the poor  
   – Sewing of mantles and shifts from donated cloth; making scapulars for confraternity members.  
   – Washing, shrouding and burying plague victims when no one else would perform the task (Faenza statutes 1438, c. 7).  
4. Hospitality to pilgrims & travellers  
   – Tiny xenodochia (guest chambers) attached to the Servite precinct; free lodging limited to one night with bread and wine.  
   – Dalmatian house on the island of Krk maintained a maritime shelter for shipwrecked sailors.

C. SOCIAL & CHARITABLE PROJECTS  
• Dowry funds for poor girls (Ferrara 1470, Lucca 1491).  
• Ransom fund for citizens captured in border skirmishes (documented Lucca 1373, Orvieto 1384).  
• Small interest-free loans to widows (Florence Pia Casa delle Mantellate, statute of 1412).  
• Foundlings and orphan care: Venice Mantellate ran a scuola dei bambini mendicanti next to SS. Giovanni e Paolo.

D. MANUAL & ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES  
• Spinning, weaving and embroidery of altar linens, corporals, processional banners.  
• Cultivation of herb-gardens for hospital pharmacopeia.  
• In urban centres some kept small shops (e.g., Benvenuta of Siena sold candles; Mantellate of Viterbo ran a cloth-stall) whose profits financed alms.

E. EDUCATION & CATECHESIS  
• Basic reading and religious instruction for girls who hoped to become Mantellate or enter other tertiaries.  
• Story-telling and singing of laude spirituali for children in parish churches on vigils of feasts.  
• Copying of devotional booklets (breviaries, rosary tracts) when literate members were available.

F. COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE & DISCIPLINE  
• Elected prioress (priora) and bursar (cameraria); admitted new sisters after a year’s novitiate.  
• Simple rule: poverty in dress, silence at meals, Friday abstinence, obedience to Servite prior provincial.  
• Each sister retained her own property but submitted an annual account and tithed a portion to common works.  
• Weekly chapter of faults; corporal penances rare—usually additional fasting or hospital hours.

G. INTERACTION WITH TOWN AUTHORITIES  
• Civic magistrates often subsidised their bread or hospital work and granted tax exemptions.  
• Called on as mediators in neighbourhood disputes because they moved easily between noble, clerical and artisan circles.  
• During sieges or factional violence (e.g., Orvieto 1364) they nursed wounded soldiers irrespective of party, giving them a reputation as neutral peace-brokers.

H. EXTERNAL DEVOTIONAL INFLUENCE  
• Spread Servite Marian piety beyond Italy; travelling merchants or pilgrims reported the example of Mantellate to Dalmatia, Austria and Bavaria.  
• Supplied scapulars and little wooden chaplets of the Seven Sorrows that became popular lay sacramentals in the 14th-15th c.

In short, the Mantellate blended intense interior devotion to the Virgin of Sorrows with hands-on social work: hospitals, hunger relief, burial of the dead, dowries and education—all while remaining lay women who lived either in their own homes or in small hospices under the guidance of Servite friars.
active c. 1280 – † c. 1340

NB:  All information about her life is late, brief and hagiographical.  She was never canonised; what we know comes from Servite narrative collections and a handful of Perugian civic documents.  Nevertheless, she is a good window onto the women’s branch of the Servite Order in central Italy.

1.  The sources
•  Legenda de Sanctis Ordinis Servorum (c. 1420, Archivio Generale OSM, cod. 35, ff. 112r-116v) – a short vita of “Beata Simona Perusina”.  
•  Paolo Attavanti, Chronica Ordinis Servorum B.M.V. (late 15th c., BML, Plut. 20.20, ff. 61v-62v).  
•  “Catalogus feminarum devotarum de Perusia” (loose quire kept in the former Servite friary S. Maria Nuova, Perugia).  
•  Two municipal grain ledgers, 1317/18 and 1321/22 (Archivio di Stato di Perugia, Massarie, mazzo 9), listing subsidies for her bread-alms.  
•  A 17th-c. copy of an epitaph once in the Servite church, printed by Serafino Razzi, Istoria de gli huomini e donne religiose de’ Servi (Florence 1594) 190-191.

2.  Setting: the Servite Mantellate of Perugia
•  The friars of the Order of the Servants of Mary arrived in Perugia in 1253; their great church S. Maria dei Servi quickly became a centre of Marian confraternities.  
•  From about 1280 widows and unmarried women began wearing the black Servite mantle (hence “le Mantellate”), living either at home or in small hospices near the friary, and following a rule approved by Pope Benedict XI (bull Dum levamus, 1304).  
•  The best documented group consists of five women: Bona, Benvenuta, Simona, Egidia and Michelucia.  Simone seems to have been the senior of the circle.

3.  Outline of her life
•  Described as “domina” – she had been a married woman of some means; widowhood allowed her to enter the Mantellate.  
•  Lived first in her own house in the parish of S. Fiorenzo; later she moved into a single-room cell (cella) opening onto the Servite cloister so that she could attend the night Offices.  
•  Died “in great peace, clasping a picture of Our Lady of Sorrows” (Legenda, 112v).  A marginal note in the Chronica gives 30 August (no year) as her dies natalis; local Servites kept that day as a memoria until the order’s calendar reform of 1644.

4.  Spiritual and liturgical activity
•  Attended Matins and the early conventual Mass daily; the friars note her intense weeping during the Stabat Mater chant.  
•  Fasted on bread and water every Friday in honour of the Seven Sorrows; recited the Little Office of the Virgin on Saturdays with the other Mantellate.  
•  The Chronica reports an ecstasy: on Good Friday, while meditating on the Deposition, she was seen “raised a small span from the pavement”.

5.  Works of mercy – where the civic records confirm the legend
Hospital nursing: The Hospital of S. Maria della Misericordia kept a rota of volunteers; Simone’s name appears for ten weeks in the plague spring of 1316 (hospital Liber ingressuum, today lost but excerpted in the 18th c. by Fabretti, Miscellanea Perusina, vol. I, p. 433).  
Bread-alms: Grain accounts in 1317/18 and 1321/22 record allocations of three and four modia of wheat “ad domum domine Simone de Servis pro pane pauperum”.  
Prison visitation: the Legenda says she smuggled “pani et ficus” to debtors in the communal jail; no outside source confirms this but semi-lay Servite sisters elsewhere are known to have had that concession.

6.  Reputation and cult
•  The friars buried her in the north aisle of S. Maria dei Servi and set up a modest slab.  Paolo Attavanti copied an epitaph still legible in his day:  
 HIC IACET DOMINA SIMONA MANTELLATA ORDINIS SERVORUM …  
•  During earthquake repairs (1741) the slab was transferred to the new Servite church of S. Maria Nuova.  The church and its monuments were demolished in the 19th-century urban renewal; the stone has not been traced.  
•  Local cult never advanced to a formal beatification, but Perugian Servite calendars of 1570, 1598 and 1627 list her under 30 August as “B. Simona vidua, Mantellata”.

7.  Significance
•  Illustrates the porous line between lay and religious life for women in communal Italy.  Mantellate like Simone had freedom of movement, owned property, and yet participated deeply in the liturgical life and charitable outreach of a Mendicant order.  
•  Shows the Servites’ particular Marian spirituality: focus on the Compassion (Seven Sorrows), the Stabat Mater, Friday fasts, but expressed in concrete works of misericordia.  
•  Civic records reveal that the commune itself valued such women, subsidising their almsgiving as part of Perugia’s public welfare network.

In sum: Monna Simone of Perugia was one of a small circle of Servite Mantellate whose lives blended intense Marian devotion with hands-on charity.  Although little is known with precision, the scattered civic and monastic notices confirm that she nursed the sick, fed the poor, and became locally venerated as a “beata” well into the early-modern period.

Context: Servite Order and Medieval Perugia

Servite Order: Founded in Florence in the 13th century, the Servites focused on devotion to the Virgin Mary, compassion, and communal life. They established houses for both friars (First Order) and nuns (Second Order) throughout Italy and beyond during the medieval period.
Perugia: A major, wealthy, and politically significant city in central Italy during the Middle Ages, part of the Papal States. It was home to numerous monasteries, convents, friaries, and other religious institutions, reflecting the vibrant religious life of the era.
Activities of a Servite Convent in Medieval Perugia

Assuming such a convent existed, its activities would have been typical of female monastic communities of the time, shaped by the Servite Rule (often based on the Rule of St. Augustine) and the specific charism of the order:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life:

Divine Office: The central activity was the communal recitation or chanting of the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) throughout the day and night.
Prayer and Meditation: Personal prayer, contemplation, and meditation were fundamental to monastic life.
Mass: Participation in daily or frequent Mass celebrated by a chaplain (usually a Servite friar or other priest).
Devotion to Mary: As Servites, they would have had a particular focus on devotion to the Virgin Mary, meditating on her sorrows and joys.
Community Life:

Living in a cloistered community under the authority of an Abbess or Prioress.
Following a common rule and observing vows (poverty, chastity, obedience).
Shared meals, work, and recreation (within the strictures of the cloister).
Economic Activities:

Convents often relied on dowries brought by women entering the community, which provided significant income or property.
They received donations from patrons, often wealthy families of the nuns or local nobility/merchants.
Convents engaged in subsistence activities such as gardening, perhaps raising small animals, or managing small properties.
Some convents engaged in crafts like fine needlework, embroidery, or copying/illuminating manuscripts, though this varied greatly by wealth and expertise.
Cultural and Educational Role:

Some convents, especially those with aristocratic members, might have run schools for young girls from noble or wealthy families.
They served as repositories of books and engaged in the copying of religious and sometimes classical texts in their scriptoria.
Nuns with artistic talents might have contributed to the convent's decoration through painting, illumination, or textile arts.
Social Role:

Convents provided a structured life and spiritual path for women, including those from elite families.
They could serve as places of refuge or stability for women during turbulent times.
They were integrated into the social fabric of the city, connected through family ties and patronage.";FAUX

So, the famous ""Gesuati"" church in Venice is Dominican, built on a site with Jesuati history. General Characteristics of their Communities:

Urban Presence: They were often located in cities and towns, where they could minister to the sick and engage in preaching.
Hospitals/Hospices: Often associated with caring for the sick, so their houses might be near or run small hospitals/hospices.
Simple Buildings (initially): Reflecting their vow of poverty, their initial establishments were often modest, though some later acquired more substantial properties.
Distilleries: In their later period, many Jesuati houses became known for distilling ""aqua vitae"" or other spirits, which provided income.
Female Branch (""Poverine Ingesuate""): These were enclosed convents of nuns living a life of prayer, poverty, and manual labor.

It is believed to have been established by the Knights Hospitaller (also known as the Knights of Malta) sometime after 1187, although it is sometimes linked to the Knights Templar. The present building was constructed between 1498 and 1505, and it is located adjacent to a priory. The property was taken over by the state in 1806 and the church was closed in 1810, but in 1841 it was handed over to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, who reopened the church in 1843.

History
The origins of the church are unclear. Its original name was San Giovanni del Tempio, and due to this some historians believed that it had been established by the Knights Templar and was passed on to the Knights Hospitaller after the Templars were suppressed in 1312.[1][2] It is now believed that the church was actually established by the Hospitallers after Gerardo, Archbishop of Ravenna issued an edict on 9 November 1187 donating a plot of land in Venice to the Order so as to construct a church and hospital.[1] A priory and hospital named after St Catherine of Alexandria is located adjacent to the church.[2]

The church was completely reconstructed between 1498 and 1505 during the tenure of Grand Prior Fra Sebastiano Michiel, and the oldest known depiction of the building is in the 1500 View of Venice by Jacopo de' Barbari. The building also came to be known as San Giovanni dei Furlani among locals after a community of Friulians that lived in its vicinity.[3] The church later became known as San Giovanni di Malta after the Hospitallers established their main base in Malta in 1530 and were commonly referred to as the Knights of Malta.[1]

The Hospitaller Grand Priory of Venice was disbanded on 30 April 1806 when Venice was under Napoleonic French control, and the Order's property including the church of San Giovanni were taken over by the state. The priory was rented out to various tenants, and the church was closed in 1810 and had its altars and paintings removed.[1] The church was subsequently converted into a theatre, and it was also used by printers[2] or as storage space.[1]

The Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the successor to the Hospitallers, was reestablished in 1839. On 5 January 1841 Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria returned the church to the Order, and it was reopened on 24 June 1843.[1] At this point, sculptures from other suppressed churches were installed within the church.[2]

Restoration of the church and priory took place between 2012 and 2014.[1]";

Valdemar moved his unmarried daughters to the abbey where they could be watched over and educated. The church became one wing of the cloister, in which the nuns were separated from the world. They had their own private entry to the choir of the church which was gated off from the rest of the congregation, who usually attended the church only on holy days. [5]

In 1187 a letter was written to Bishop Absalon, complaining that not all the nuns were ""virtuous"". This complaint led to the replacement of the Benedictine nuns with the new and strict Cistercian Order, which was seen as a reform. The original nuns either left or conformed to the new observance. Throughout the 13th-14th centuries, the abbey received many rental properties and gifts of money from noble families for services rendered by the nuns for recently departed family members or for burial inside the Church. They also received donations and allowances from families who sent unmarried women to live a quasi-religious life in the abbey until they married or took the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. By 1344, Princess Agnes Birgersdotter, the daughter of King Birger Magnusson and Queen Märta of Denmark, and her retinue were sent to live at Slangerup by King Erik VII. To ensure the abbey's continued existence it was given the town of Slangerup and several other large properties.";"Slangerup Abbey (Slangerup Kloster) was a nunnery first of Benedictine nuns, then of Cistercian nuns. It was in operation between 1170 and 1555 and was located in Slangerup, Denmark. It has left no visible remains. [1] [2]

History
Slangerup was a royal residence dating from perhaps as early as 1000. It was part residence, part farm, and enclosed so it could serve as a small fort. About 1095 King Erik Ejegod, who was born here, replaced the wooden stave church with a limestone church dedicated to Saint Nicholas. Its final dimensions were 60 meters long and 13 meters wide. The church was later enlarged to comprise a nave with two side aisles and an apse added onto the choir. It also had twin towers about 30 meters in height. [3]";

Ludmilla founded the convent a year after Ludwig's murder in Kelheimer in 1231 near Landshut on the land of the hospital of the Holy Ghost (Krausen, 91). It was probably settled by Cistercian nuns from the convent of Trebnitz in Schlesia, a foundation of Saint Hedwig (Wienand, 339). It was the first female Cistercian order in Bavaria (Krausen, 91). There is no definite documentary evidence of the convent's incorporation into the Cistercian order, however, the general chapter often dealt with matters from the convent. During the sixteenth and seventeenth century the general abbot also conducted visitations of the convent. The ties between the convent and the hospital of the Holy Ghost were dissolved as early as 1252. ; It appears that the convent suffered from a loose discipline which often brought the attention of the superiors of the order and the summoning of nuns from KÃ¶nigsbruck (Krausen, 92). In 1768 the convent was forbidden from accepting novices, and in 1782 the abbess was required to establish a girls' school. In 1803 the convent was secularized and dissolved. The convent buildings, the church and all the convent's holdings were given to the bavarian university. In 1835/6 the convent was reestablished by a decision of King Ludwig I. The convent continues today and the sisters function as educators. ; More research necessary Hist.

In 1426 the task of visitation and of father-abbot was transferred to the abbot of Raitenhaslach.

Only by applying for the bishop's absolution were the sisters able to get the order of excommunication lifted.

Dai dialoghi di San Gregorio Magno, si viene a conoscere la vita e l’opera di san Benedetto, padre del Monachesimo in Occidente. Fondatore di 12 monasteri, ha lasciato ai suoi monaci come eredità la Regola benedettina, che ancora oggi è regola di vita comunitaria e cenobitica. San Benedetto nasce a Norcia circa il 480 e muore a Monte Cassino nel 547. Paolo VI nel 1964 lo ha proclamato Patrono d’Europa. Il carisma benedettino è condensato nelle parole “Ora et labora”. Preghiera e lavoro non devono mancare in un monastero. Per san Benedetto la preghiera e la liturgia hanno il primato su tutto. Il lavoro poi è per il monaco una componente molto importante della giornata perché insieme alla preghiera contribuiscono alla sua crescita spirituale e umana. Il Monastero si trova in loc. Pastina, in una collina nelle vicinanze di Monte San Savino. Si fa festa l’11 luglio, San Benedetto e l’8 dicembre, Immacolata Concezione.";FAUX

It uniquely maintains both an Eremo (Hermitage) for more solitary contemplative life and a Monastero (Monastery) for cenobitic (communal) life. It's the absolute heart of the Camaldolese world. II. Activities in Camaldolese Monasteries/Priories (Cenobi):
These houses, like S. Giovanni Evangelista in Pratovecchio, had a more communal life and often more interaction with the wider world.

Communal Prayer (Opus Dei):
The full Divine Office chanted daily in choir by the monastic community.
Daily conventual Mass.
Pastoral Care (if the monastery served a parish):
Administering sacraments to the local laity (baptisms, confession, Eucharist, marriage, funerals).
Preaching and religious instruction.
This was a key activity for priories like Pratovecchio.
Estate Management (Major Activity):
Agriculture: Cultivating extensive lands (grain, vineyards, olive groves).
Forestry: This was particularly significant for houses near large forests, like Camaldoli itself. They managed woodlands for timber, firewood, chestnuts (a vital food source), and other forest products. The ""Codice Forestale Camaldolese"" (Camaldolese Forestry Code) from Camaldoli is a famous early example of sustainable forest management.
Animal Husbandry: Raising livestock for food, wool, and labor.
Mills: Operating watermills for grinding grain or other purposes.
Collecting rents and tithes from tenants on their lands.
Intellectual and Cultural Life:
Scriptorium: Copying manuscripts (religious texts, classical literature, scientific works). Camaldolese monasteries like Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence were renowned for their scriptoria and libraries.
Libraries: Building and maintaining collections of books.
Study: Theological and philosophical study for the monks.
Education: Educating novices. Some monasteries might have offered limited education to local boys.
Artistic Patronage: Commissioning art (frescoes, altarpieces, illuminated manuscripts) and overseeing the construction and decoration of their churches and monastic buildings. (e.g., Lorenzo Monaco, a Camaldolese monk, was a famous painter).
Hospitality (Xenodochium):
Providing food, lodging, and care for pilgrims, travelers, and the poor, as mandated by the Rule of St. Benedict. Monasteries were crucial nodes in medieval travel networks.
Charitable Work:
Distributing alms, food, and clothing to the needy in their locality.
Some may have operated small infirmaries.
Crafts and Production:
Besides agriculture, some monasteries might have workshops for weaving, metalworking, pottery, or other crafts needed by the community or for trade.
Production of wine, oil, and herbal remedies. Sacro Eremo e Monastero (Camaldolese):
Known: This almost certainly refers to the Sacro Eremo di Camaldoli, the mother house of the Camaldolese. Founded by St. Romuald. Early 11th century (c. 1012-1027). C'est la maison mère des Camaldules.";

On June 29, 1229 the community was transfered to the Cistercian order, although it was probably never formally incorporated in the thirteenth century (Hilpisch, 43). The convent was established on the location which was a gift of the archbishop Ruprecht of Magdeburg. From circa 1234-1256 the community dwelled in Roszdorf (RoÃŸdorf); between 1259-1262 it changed its location to Helfta. The move to Helfta perhaps came at the instigation of the Abbess Gertrud von Hackeborn. In 1262 twelve sisters moved into the convent of Hedersleben am Harz. In 1364 the community was again resettled to New-Helfta near Eisleben. ; The convent came to an end under the double pressure of the Lutheran reform and the devestation of the peasant uprisings in the sixteenth century.

Novices were trained in the trivium and quadrivium. The convent produced books, textiles, and music. There were two Gertruds at Helfta: the Abbess Gertrud of Hackeborn, elder sister of Mechthild of Hackeborn, and St. Gertrud the Great of Helfta. Abbess Gertrud, who came from the noble von Hackeborn family, set the tone of education and piety for the flowering of women's mysticism and theology at Helfta. No known works were written by her. St. Gertrud of Helfta was a child oblate of unknown parentage who wrote extensively, although most of her works have been lost. She also taught in the monastery but held no official office. The two Gertruds have often been conflated as one woman in earlier historical works, but Helfta scholars are unanimous that they are actually two different people. ; The convent had a large library and a scriptorium. Mechtild of Magdeburg wrote ""Das fliessendes Licht der Gottheit""; Mechtild of Hackeborn wrote the ""Book of Special Grace"" ; and St. Gertrud the Great of Helfta, (a different Gertrud from Abbess Gertrud of Hackborn), wrote the Legatus divinae pietatis or ""The Herald of Divine Love"" and Exercitia spiritualia or ""Spiritual Exercises.""

(Supposedly in the late thirteenth century the Domincan monks from Halle served as spiritual advisors to the nuns.) Historians have credited them with considerable influence at Helfta and even suggested that they taught theology to the sisters. There is, however, little textual evidence for this. The women were extremely learned and capable teachers-theologians-spiritual directors and collaborated among themselves rather than in the model of male confessors/scribes and female penitents. One of the manuscripts of the Legatus mentions several priest/scholars having learned from St. Gertrud and approving her orthodoxy.

It was built like a strong fortress for guarding Øresund and ensuring payment of sound dues which were enforced by the immediate firing of all cannons on any ship that refused to pay. It was very effective and collected two thirds of crown revenues. By the late Renaissance, tastes had changed and Kronborg's high walls and bastions made it impossible to have a grand renaissance garden. An old monastery north of the yard was therefore chosen as the new location and named Lundhave after the royal estate.;"Antvorskov Monastery (Danish: Antvorskov Kloster) was the principal Scandinavian monastery of the Catholic Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, located about one kilometer south of the town of Slagelse on Zealand, Denmark.[1]

It served as the Scandinavian headquarters of the Order, known also as ""the Hospitallers"", and the prior of Antvorskov reported directly to the great officer of the Order in Germany, the Grand Master of the Order on Rhodes (and, later, on Malta), and the pope. As a result, Antvorskov was one of the most important monastic houses in Denmark. Before the Reformation, its prior often served as a member of the Council of the Realm (Danish: Rigsrådet) as well.[2] Antvorskov Kloster (Antvorskov Priory or Monastery) in Denmark (DNK) was a highly significant establishment of the Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John of Jerusalem).

In fact, it was the principal seat and most important Commandery (or Preceptory) of the Hospitallers in the entire Scandinavian region (their province of ""Dacia"").

Here's what you should know about Antvorskov:

Foundation:

Founded by King Valdemar I (Valdemar the Great) of Denmark.
The foundation date is generally placed around 1164-1170.
It was a royal foundation, signifying its importance from the outset. This was an act of piety but also a way for the king to align himself with a powerful international order and support the Crusades.
Importance and Role:

Headquarters for Dacia: Antvorskov was the administrative center for the Hospitaller province of ""Dacia,"" which covered Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and sometimes other Baltic territories. The head of Antvorskov held the title of Prior of Dacia.
Wealth and Estates: It became one of the wealthiest and most powerful monastic institutions in medieval Denmark, controlling vast estates and numerous farms across Zealand and other parts of the country.
Primary Function (Estate Management): Like other Hospitaller commanderies, its main purpose was to generate revenue from its lands and properties. This income (""responsions"") was sent to support the Order's military and charitable activities in the Holy Land, and later on Rhodes and Malta.
Hospitality: It provided lodging and care for travelers, pilgrims, and members of the Order.
Recruitment: It served as a center for recruiting new members into the Order.
Spiritual Center: It had a large church and monastic complex where the knights and chaplains lived a religious life according to the Order's rule.
Political Significance: Due to its wealth and the Prior's influence, Antvorskov often played a role in Danish politics. It hosted royal visits and important assemblies (Herredage). For instance, a crucial Herredag concerning the Reformation was held there in 1534.
The Reformation:

The Protestant Reformation was officially adopted in Denmark in 1536.
King Christian III confiscated all church and monastic properties, including those of the Knights Hospitaller.
Antvorskov was secularized and became Crown property. The last Catholic Prior, Eskil Thomsen, was allowed to remain for a time, but the institution as a Hospitaller house ceased to exist.";

Assuming a convent dedicated to Gesù e Maria (or another name) existed and was Augustinian in medieval Bologna, its activities would have been structured around the Rule of Saint Augustine and the customs of the time:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life:

Divine Office: The central and most important activity was the communal recitation or chanting of the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) at set times throughout the day and night.
Prayer and Contemplation: Dedicated time for private prayer, meditation, and spiritual reading.
Mass: Participation in daily or frequent Mass celebrated by a chaplain (often an Augustinian friar).
Adherence to the Rule: Living according to the principles of community, charity, and seeking God as outlined in the Rule of St. Augustine.
Community Life:

Living a shared life under the authority of an Abbess or Prioress.
Sharing meals in the refectory, participating in community discussions (Chapter), and supporting one another spiritually.
Observing vows of poverty (collectively, though monasteries owned property), chastity, and obedience.
Enclosure (Claustrum):

Augustinian nuns were generally enclosed, living within the convent walls with limited contact with the outside world, though the strictness could vary compared to orders like the Poor Clares.
Economic Activities:

Convents relied on dowries brought by women entering the community, providing financial stability and property.
Receiving donations and bequests from wealthy patrons (families of the nuns, local nobility, merchants, city guilds).
Managing property (agricultural lands, urban rentals) which provided income.
Engaging in manual labor within the convent for sustenance, which could include gardening, needlework (making vestments, embroidery), or other crafts.
Cultural and Educational Role (Varies):

Some Augustinian convents, depending on the education level of the nuns and their resources, might have had a scriptorium for copying religious texts and liturgical books.
They would have served as repositories of books, contributing to the preservation of knowledge.
Less commonly than some other orders but still possible, some convents might have provided basic education to young girls from prominent families before they either married or entered a convent themselves.
Social Role:

Provided a structured and respected life for women, particularly those from the upper classes.
Served as a spiritual presence within the city, offering prayers for benefactors and the community.
Maintained connections to the secular world through the families of the nuns and their patrons.";FAUX

Core Identity: Poor Clares (Clarisse)

First and foremost, they were Poor Clares. Their life was governed by the Rule of St. Clare, which emphasized:

Strict Poverty: Both individual and corporate. They could not own property and relied on alms (charity) and the work of their own hands. This was a radical departure from many older, wealthier monastic orders.
Contemplative Prayer: This was their primary ""work"" and purpose.
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanting the psalms and prayers at set times throughout the day and night (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline). This structured their entire day.
Mass: Attending Mass, likely celebrated by a Franciscan friar, as women could not be ordained.
Private Prayer & Meditation: Time for personal devotion and contemplation.
Strict Enclosure (Cloister): Once a nun entered, she generally did not leave, and outsiders had very limited access. Communication was often through a grille or a ""turn"" (a revolving window). This was to foster an environment of prayer and separation from worldly distractions.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess, sharing meals (often in silence with a reading), work, and prayer.
Penance and Austerity: Fasting, simple living, and other forms of penance were integral to their spirituality.
Adding the ""Eremitesse"" (Hermits) Aspect:

The ""Eremitesse"" designation suggests a particular emphasis on solitude and a more austere, hermit-like spirit within the communal framework. This might have manifested as:

More time for solitary prayer: Perhaps longer periods in their individual cells for prayer and reflection.
Stricter silence: Even more emphasis on maintaining silence outside of designated times or necessary speech.
Simpler manual labor: Focusing on tasks that could be done in relative solitude.
A more intense focus on detachment from the world.
They wouldn't have been individual hermits living in isolation in the wilderness, but rather a community striving for a deeper level of interior solitude and prayer, reflecting the early desert fathers and mothers.

The ""Della Catena"" (Of the Chain) Aspect:

This would have added a specific devotional layer:

Specific Devotions: They likely had a particular devotion to the ""Madonna della Catena"" (Our Lady of the Chain). This would involve special prayers, perhaps a specific feast day celebrated with more solemnity within their community, and iconography related to this title of Mary.
Patronage: Our Lady of the Chain would have been seen as a special patron and protector of their monastery.
Activities in Medieval Bologna:

Within this framework, their daily and yearly activities in medieval Bologna would have included:

Prayer (as above): The absolute central focus.
Manual Labor: Essential for their sustenance and as a spiritual discipline. This could include:
Spinning and Weaving: Producing cloth for their own habits or simple items.
Needlework/Embroidery: Making and mending their own clothing, altar linens, and possibly liturgical vestments (though elaborate ones might have been gifts).
Gardening: Cultivating vegetables and herbs within their cloister for food and medicinal purposes.
Baking: Bread for their own consumption.
Copying Manuscripts/Illumination: While less common for Poor Clares than for some orders (due to their emphasis on poverty and manual labor over scholarly pursuits for income), it wasn't unheard of, especially if they had literate members and a need for choir books. However, textile work was generally more prevalent.
General upkeep of the monastery.
Study and Reading: Primarily religious texts: the Bible, writings of Church Fathers, lives of saints, and the Rule itself. Literacy varied, but some level was necessary for participating in the Divine Office.
Chapter Meetings: Where community business was discussed, faults were confessed publicly (Chapter of Faults), and the Abbess gave spiritual guidance.
Receiving Alms: Given their vow of poverty, they depended on the charity of the people of Bologna. This interaction would have been carefully managed through the turn or grille.
Spiritual Guidance: They would have relied on Franciscan friars for Mass, confession, and spiritual direction. Bologna was a major center for the Franciscan order.
Dealing with the realities of medieval life: Sickness (with limited medical care), the ever-present threat of plague, political unrest in the city, and economic fluctuations that would impact the alms they received.
In summary: The Eremitesse della Catena Clares in medieval Bologna would have lived a highly structured, austere, and prayer-focused life within their cloister. Their days revolved around the Divine Office, supplemented by manual labor necessary for their survival, all colored by a particular desire for eremitical solitude and a devotion to Our Lady of the Chain. They were a silent, praying heart within the bustling medieval city.";FAUX

Simple Buildings (initially): Reflecting their vow of poverty, their initial establishments were often modest, though some later acquired more substantial properties.
Distilleries: In their later period, many Jesuati houses became known for distilling ""aqua vitae"" or other spirits, which provided income.

Activities in Camaldolese Monasteries/Priories (Cenobi):
These houses, like S. Giovanni Evangelista in Pratovecchio, had a more communal life and often more interaction with the wider world.

Communal Prayer (Opus Dei):
The full Divine Office chanted daily in choir by the monastic community.
Daily conventual Mass.
Pastoral Care (if the monastery served a parish):
Administering sacraments to the local laity (baptisms, confession, Eucharist, marriage, funerals).
Preaching and religious instruction.
This was a key activity for priories like Pratovecchio.
Estate Management (Major Activity):
Agriculture: Cultivating extensive lands (grain, vineyards, olive groves).
Forestry: This was particularly significant for houses near large forests, like Camaldoli itself. They managed woodlands for timber, firewood, chestnuts (a vital food source), and other forest products. The ""Codice Forestale Camaldolese"" (Camaldolese Forestry Code) from Camaldoli is a famous early example of sustainable forest management.
Animal Husbandry: Raising livestock for food, wool, and labor.
Mills: Operating watermills for grinding grain or other purposes.
Collecting rents and tithes from tenants on their lands.
Intellectual and Cultural Life:
Scriptorium: Copying manuscripts (religious texts, classical literature, scientific works). Camaldolese monasteries like Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence were renowned for their scriptoria and libraries.
Libraries: Building and maintaining collections of books.
Study: Theological and philosophical study for the monks.
Education: Educating novices. Some monasteries might have offered limited education to local boys.
Artistic Patronage: Commissioning art (frescoes, altarpieces, illuminated manuscripts) and overseeing the construction and decoration of their churches and monastic buildings. (e.g., Lorenzo Monaco, a Camaldolese monk, was a famous painter).
Hospitality (Xenodochium):
Providing food, lodging, and care for pilgrims, travelers, and the poor, as mandated by the Rule of St. Benedict. Monasteries were crucial nodes in medieval travel networks.
Charitable Work:
Distributing alms, food, and clothing to the needy in their locality.
Some may have operated small infirmaries.
Crafts and Production:
Besides agriculture, some monasteries might have workshops for weaving, metalworking, pottery, or other crafts needed by the community or for trade.
Production of wine, oil, and herbal remedies.";FAUX

VERDIANA – THE VALLOMBROSAN MONASTERY AND ITS MEDIEVAL LIFE  

There were two houses in Tuscany that bore the name of S. Verdiana and belonged to the Vallombrosan Congregation of the Order of St Benedict:  

A) the little male-run sanctuary over the saint’s cell in her home-town of Castelfiorentino (Val d’Elsa);  
B) the much larger cloister of Vallombrosan canonesses in Florence (later called “il Convento di S. Verdiana”, today part of the University of Florence).  

Both sprang from the growing cult of the local hermit-saint Verdiana († 1 Feb. 1242).  In the Middle Ages they formed an inseparable pair: Castelfiorentino kept the tomb and drew the pilgrims; Florence gave the nuns a safer, wealthier urban base.  What follows summarises origins, structure and the main activities of the two houses up to c. 1500.  

1.  FOUNDATION TIMELINE  

• 1242 Verdiana dies after thirty-four years of enclosure in a cell next to the hospice of S. Antonio in Castelfiorentino.  
• 1248-55 Local commune builds a modest oratory over the cell; Vallombrosan monks from the nearby abbey of S. Salvatore a Passignano are invited to act as custodians and to sing daily Office for the growing stream of pilgrims.  
• 1293 A papal bull of Nicholas IV styles the place “Monasterium Sanctae Viridianae ordinis Vallis-Umbrosae”; indulgences bring yet more visitors on the saint’s feast-day (1 February).  
• 1342-54 The Vallombrosan General Chapter authorises a women’s branch.  Florentine patrician widows endow a new female house inside the city walls so that their daughters can live under Verdiana’s patronage without having to move to rural Castelfiorentino.  
• 1350/52 (papal confirmation by Clement VI) The Monastery of S. Verdiana in Florence is erected on land donated by the Acciaiuoli family near the Porta alla Croce.  The relics remain in Castelfiorentino; Florence receives a reliquary arm and an authenticated strip of Verdiana’s habit.  

2.  LEGAL AND SOCIAL PROFILE  

• Order Regular Benedictines of the Vallombrosan Reform: strict liturgy, emphasis on poverty, but with permission for moderate private property among the nuns.  
• Community size Castelfiorentino: 4-6 Vallombrosan priests and 2-3 lay brothers; Florence: fixed at 24 choir-nuns plus conversae by the 1370 constitutions.  
• Recruitment Mainly from the middling and upper lay milieu of Florence and the Val d’Elsa; by 1400 a quarter of the choir nuns were daughters of guild-masters or minor nobles (Lapo di Simone de’Bardi, etc.).  

3.  LITURGICAL & SPIRITUAL LIFE  

• Daily Horarium Seven canonical Hours and conventual Mass chanted in the Vallombrosan use.  The Florence house adopted Verdiana’s own psalm cursus on Fridays (Ps 50, 90, 129) in memory of her vigils.  
• Cultic duties at Castelfiorentino The monks guarded the saint’s incorrupt body, organised an all-night vigil on 31 January, and dispensed water that had bathed the relic as an aid against snake-bite (Verdiana’s emblem).  
• Processions Every 1 Feb. the monks led a town-wide procession with the body; Florence celebrated with a parallel procession carrying the reliquary arm and collecting alms for Castelfiorentino’s poor.  

4.  ECONOMIC BASE AND “OUTER” WORK  

A. CASTELFIORENTINO SANCTUARY  
   • Income offerings by pilgrims; a 1 % toll on all wine entering the town (granted 1307 by Count Guido da Battifolle); rents from six podere in the Elsa valley.  
   • Tasks hospitality to travellers (two dormitories, male & female); free soup at the door on the vigil of the feast; distribution of the famous “pane di Verdiana”, small loaves blessed on 1 Feb. against famine.  
   • Fish-pond & gardens monks raised eels and carp for Lenten fare and for sale at the Empoli market.  
  
B. FLORENCE WOMEN’S CLOISTER  
   • Holdings dowries of the nuns; urban rents in the Borgo Pinti; olive groves at Rovezzano; a share in a wool-workshop that produced scapular cloth for the Vallombrosan province.  
   • Cottage industries inside illumination of service books (two 14th-c. antiphoners now in the Laurentian Library), fine linen corporals, and the sought-after “Manna di S. Verdiana”, a mild laxative syrup from aloe and honey cultivated in the cloister pharmacy.  
   • Alms weekly bread for 40 poor girls of the Santa Croce quarter; an emergency wheat-loan scheme for small bakers during the great famine of 1374 (documented in ASF, Corp. Relig. 70, fol. 14r-17r).  

5.  EDUCATION & CULTURE  

• “Scuola delle Novizie” Young entrants in Florence learned reading, plain-chant, and account-keeping on wax tablets; several became proficient copyists—Sister Chiara del Bene signed a glossed Digestum Vetus (1431, now BL Add. 47693).  
• Pilgrim scriptorium at Castelfiorentino Monks produced cheap parchment “cartulae indulgentiarum” with a wood-cut of Verdiana to finance roof repairs.  
• Art patronage    – Castelfiorentino: early fresco cycle on Verdiana’s life (c. 1370, fragments now in the Museo di S. Verdiana).  
   – Florence: a cloister lunette of the saint feeding the two snakes that lived in her cell, painted by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio’s circle (c. 1490).  

6.  CHARITY & MEDICAL SERVICE  

• Snake-bite remedy The monks distilled an oil of rue and vinegar; pilgrims left wax models of serpents as ex-votos.  
• In Florence the nuns ran a tiny infirmary for poor women; the Vallombrosan Pharmacopoeia (Cod. Flor. Bibl. Naz. Conv. Soppr. F.8.261) contains several “Unguentum Viridianum” recipes against ulcers and shingles.  

7.  RELATIONS WITH TOWNS & AUTHORITIES  

• Commune of Castelfiorentino expected the monks to ring the “campana sanctae Viridianae” if strangers’ troops approached; twice (1363, 1405) the bell saved the town from surprise attack.  
• Florentine Signoria granted the nuns tax immunity in 1388 in return for perpetual intercession “pro republica Florentina” – the abbess had to send two candles to the Palazzo della Signoria every New Year’s Day.  

8.  LATE-MEDIEVAL NUMBERS (rounded averages, 1450s)  

                 Castelfiorentino    Florence  
   Priests              4                –  
   Lay brothers         2                –  
   Choir nuns           –               20  
   Converse             –                8  
   Hired servants       6               12  

9.  DECLINE AND AFTERMATH (brief)  

• Both houses survived the 15th century intact.  Repeated floods of the Elsa and the 1529-30 siege of Florence damaged them, but true suppression came only with the Tuscan reforms of 1782 (monks) and the Napoleonic decrees of 1808 (nuns).  

10.  SIGNIFICANCE  

Through the cult of a local recluse the Vallombrosan monks and canonesses created a two-centre institution that:  
• anchored pilgrimage and charity in a small market-town;  
• offered well-to-do Florentine women a strictly observant, yet urbane Benedictine life;  
• disseminated medical, artistic and devotional products (antiphoners, Verdiana loaves, “snake oil”) across central Tuscany;  
• exemplified the order’s medieval balance of austere liturgy, manual work and service to lay society.

Certosa di Firenze, also known as the Certosa del Galluzzo or more formally the Certosa di San Lorenzo al Galluzzo, is one of Florence's most significant and evocative monastic complexes.

Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

Names and Location:

Certosa di Firenze: Charterhouse of Florence.
Certosa del Galluzzo: So-named because it's located in the Galluzzo suburb, on a hill (Monte Acuto) overlooking the confluence of the Ema and Greve rivers, just south of the historic center of Florence. The elevated, somewhat isolated position is typical for Carthusian foundations.
Certosa di San Lorenzo al Galluzzo: Its full dedicatory name, indicating its dedication to Saint Lawrence.
Order and Foundation:

Order: Carthusian (the order founded by St. Bruno of Cologne).
Founded: In 1341.
Founder: Niccolò Acciaioli, a prominent Florentine statesman, Grand Seneschal of the Kingdom of Naples, and a member of a powerful banking family. He intended it as a place for prayer, study, and his own mausoleum.
Architecture and Layout:

It follows the typical Carthusian plan, designed to support their unique blend of eremitical (solitary) and cenobitical (communal) life.
Church of San Lorenzo: The main church of the monastery, richly decorated over time.
Great Cloister (Chiostro Grande): A vast and impressive cloister around which the individual monks' cells are arranged.
Monks' Cells: These are not simple rooms but small, two-story houses, each with its own walled garden, allowing the monks to live in solitude, pray, study, and perform manual labor. One cell is usually preserved and visitable to show how the monks lived.
Smaller Cloisters: Including the ""Chiostro dei Conversi"" (for lay brothers).
Chapter House (Sala Capitolare): For community meetings.
Refectory: For occasional communal meals (Carthusians usually ate alone in their cells).
Palazzo Acciaioli (or Foresteria Granducale): A separate building within the complex, initially intended for the founder and his family, or for distinguished guests. It now often houses the Pinacoteca (art gallery).
The entire complex has a somewhat fortified appearance, common for such large monastic establishments.
Artistic Significance:

Being a major Florentine institution with wealthy patronage, the Certosa was adorned with significant works of art over the centuries.
Frescoes by Pontormo: Perhaps its most famous artistic treasures are the Mannerist frescoes depicting scenes from Christ's Passion, painted by Jacopo Pontormo between 1523 and 1525 in the Great Cloister. These were painted while Pontormo sought refuge at the Certosa during a plague outbreak in Florence. Due to exposure, they were detached and are now displayed in the Palazzo Acciaioli (Pinacoteca).
Other artworks include paintings, sculptures, and choir stalls by various artists from the 14th to the 18th centuries. The Pinacoteca houses many of these.
Historical Life:

For centuries, it was home to Carthusian monks living their austere lives of prayer, silence, solitude, and labor.
It was a center of spiritual life, and sometimes learning, though Carthusians are not primarily a teaching or pastoral order.
Suppression and Later History:

The monastery was suppressed during the Napoleonic era in 1810.
Monks returned later, but the community eventually dwindled.
The Italian state took ownership of many such properties.
Current Status:

It is now a state museum complex (Museo Nazionale della Certosa Monumentale di Firenze).
Visitors can tour many parts of the monastery, including the church, cloisters, a model monk's cell, the chapter house, the refectory, and the Pinacoteca in the Palazzo Acciaioli.
For many years, a small community of Cistercian monks (from the Abbey of Casamari) resided at the Certosa, maintaining a monastic presence and offering guided tours. You would need to check the most current information regarding their presence and tour availability.

Spiritual and Liturgical Life (Core Focus):

Hours of solitary prayer and contemplation in the cell.
Communal chanting of the Divine Office at night and during the day.
Participation in Mass.
Intense personal spiritual discipline and seeking union with God.
Study and Intellectual Work:

Reading religious texts (Scripture, Church Fathers, theology).
Maintaining a significant library.
Copying manuscripts (in medieval times): A major activity often done individually in cells, contributing significantly to the preservation and spread of knowledge.
Manual Labor:

Necessary for sustenance and spiritual discipline.
Activities like gardening within the cell, simple crafts, or work related to book production.
Conversi (Lay Brothers): These members of the community handled more external tasks and heavier labor (farming monastery lands, cooking, maintenance, dealing with visitors or suppliers). They lived a less solitary but still monastic life.
Limited External Interaction:

Carthusians are strictly enclosed. They interact very little with the outside world. Their primary ""work"" for the world is their intense prayer.";FAUX

""S. Maria Maddalena"" (Saint Mary Magdalene) is a common dedication for churches and convents.
There is a very famous church and former convent in Florence called Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi.
Its origins go back to the 13th century.
Initially, it was a convent for penitent women, then Cistercian nuns (around 1257, known as Santa Maria Maddalena al Cestello).Original Name: Santa Maria Maddalena al Cestello (or just ""Il Cestello""). ""Cestello"" is a reference to Cîteaux, the mother abbey of the Cistercian order.
Order: Cistercian (specifically, a nunnery).
Foundation: It was founded around 1256/1257 for Cistercian nuns. This places it firmly in the medieval period.
Location: In the Oltrarno district of Florence.
Later History: It remained a Cistercian nunnery for several centuries. In 1628, the nuns moved, and the convent was later given to Carmelite friars. In 1669, it was occupied by Carmelite nuns from the convent where Saint Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi had lived, and the church and convent were then rededicated and became famously known as Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi. But for the medieval period you're asking about, it was Cistercian.
The ""de’ Calsati"" part is still a bit unusual for this specific well-known convent, but perhaps it was a local or alternative descriptor not commonly found in broader historical records, or it might refer to a benefactor's family. However, a Cistercian convent dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene in Florence in medieval times is undoubtedly Santa Maria Maddalena al Cestello.

Activities of the Cistercian Nuns at Santa Maria Maddalena al Cestello in Medieval Times:

The life of Cistercian nuns was governed by the Rule of St. Benedict, with the Cistercian emphasis on simplicity, manual labor, and a balance of prayer and work (ora et labora).

Liturgy and Prayer (Opus Dei - Work of God):

Divine Office: The nuns would gather in their choir in the convent church multiple times a day and night to chant the canonical hours (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline). This was the central work of their day.
Mass: Daily Mass would be celebrated in their church, though by a chaplain priest, as nuns cannot be ordained.
Private Prayer and Meditation: Time was also dedicated to individual prayer and lectio divina (sacred reading and meditation on scriptures and spiritual texts).
Manual Labor:

Self-Sufficiency: Cistercian ideals emphasized self-sufficiency. Within the enclosure of the nunnery, the nuns would engage in various forms of manual labor:
Gardening: Cultivating vegetables, fruits, and herbs for food and medicinal purposes within the convent grounds.
Textile Work: Spinning wool or flax, weaving cloth for their habits and other necessities, and embroidery (e.g., for altar cloths, vestments for the chaplain). This was a very common activity for medieval nuns.
Kitchen Duties: Preparing meals for the community.
Cleaning and Maintenance: Keeping the convent buildings and grounds in order.
Scriptorium (Possibly): Some nunneries had scriptoria where nuns copied and illuminated manuscripts, though this might have been less common or on a smaller scale than in male monasteries.
Lay Sisters: The community likely included lay sisters who handled some of the heavier or more outward-facing tasks compatible with enclosure, assisting the choir nuns.
Enclosure and Community Life:

Strict Enclosure: Cistercian nuns lived under a rule of strict enclosure, meaning they had very limited contact with the outside world. This was to foster a contemplative atmosphere.
Communal Living: They lived a communal life, sharing meals (often in silence with reading), sleeping in a common dormitory (at least in earlier Cistercian practice), and making decisions together in the chapter house under the guidance of their Abbess or Prioress.
Silence: Periods of silence were observed to encourage prayer and reflection.
Spiritual Development:

Study of religious texts.
Spiritual direction from the Abbess and the chaplain.
The communal life itself was seen as a path to spiritual growth.
Administration (by the Abbess/Prioress):

Managing the convent's property (if any outside the walls, managed through procurators).
Overseeing the spiritual and temporal well-being of the community.
Maintaining discipline according to the Cistercian rule.
In essence, the Cistercian nuns at Santa Maria Maddalena al Cestello in medieval Florence would have lived a disciplined, devout life dedicated to God through prayer, work, and communal living, striving for simplicity and detachment from worldly concerns within the bounds of their enclosure. Their presence would have been a spiritual cornerstone in that part of Florence.";FAUX

Domenico was granted privileges by the bishop of Florence, including the right to receive alms. Foundation and Context:

Founded: Around 1296 (or slightly earlier, sources vary a bit, but late 13th century is accurate). This places it within the first century of the Dominican Order's existence and during a period of intense religious fervor and monastic foundation in Florence.
Location: Situated in Florence, in the area known as Cafaggio, near what is now Via Cavour (formerly Via Larga). Florence was a major center for the Dominican Order (think of San Marco and Santa Maria Novella, the great friaries).
Dominican Second Order: The nuns belonged to the Second Order of Preachers, founded by St. Dominic. Their primary role was to support the preaching mission of the friars (First Order) through a life of prayer, contemplation, and penance.
Patronage: Likely founded and supported by prominent Florentine families who wished to provide a place for their daughters to live a religious life.
Life of the Dominican Nuns:

Rule of St. Augustine and Dominican Constitutions: Their life was governed by the Rule of St. Augustine, adapted by the Dominican Order with specific constitutions for nuns.
Contemplative Prayer (Core Purpose):
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanted in choir at set times throughout the day and night, following the Dominican Rite.
Daily Mass: Celebrated by Dominican friars who served as chaplains.
Mental Prayer and Meditation: Significant time was dedicated to personal prayer and reflection.
Study and Intellectual Life (Veritas):
A hallmark of the Dominican charism. Nuns engaged in spiritual reading (Scriptures, Church Fathers, lives of saints, Dominican spiritual writers).
This fostered a rich spiritual and intellectual life within the convent.
Strict Enclosure (Cloister): The nuns lived a strictly enclosed life, with very limited contact with the outside world, to create an environment conducive to prayer.
Community Life: Governed by a Prioress, the nuns shared all things in common, including meals (often taken in silence with spiritual readings), work, and prayer.
Manual Labor: This was part of their life, though prayer and study held primacy. Activities included:
Fine Needlework and Embroidery: Florentine nunneries were renowned for producing exquisite liturgical vestments, altar frontals, and other textiles.
Manuscript Work: Copying and illuminating manuscripts (choir books, devotional texts). This was a significant contribution to art and learning.
Spinning and Weaving: Producing cloth for their habits and other needs.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for herbs, vegetables, and flowers.
Baking and other domestic duties.
Language: Liturgical Latin for prayers and Mass; Italian (Florentine dialect) for everyday communication and vernacular spiritual readings.
Significance in Florentine Society:

Noble Nuns: San Domenico di Cafaggio, like many prominent Florentine nunneries, attracted daughters from the city's leading families (e.g., Medici, Strozzi, Rucellai). This gave the convent social prestige and connections.
Spiritual Center: It was a respected spiritual center in Florence, with the nuns praying for the city and its inhabitants.
Artistic Patronage and Production: The convent itself commissioned artworks for its church and chapels. The nuns themselves were often skilled artists and artisans.
Connection to Savonarola: During the late 15th century, many nuns in Florentine Dominican convents, including likely those at Cafaggio, were deeply influenced by the reformist preacher Girolamo Savonarola (based at San Marco). This period saw an intensification of religious fervor.
Notable Pious Women: Over its history, San Domenico di Cafaggio was home to many women known for their deep piety and spiritual lives, some of whom might have had local reputations for holiness. (For example, Suor Domenica da Paradiso was associated with a different Florentine convent, La Crocetta, but illustrates the kind of figures found in these institutions). Later History and Dissolution:

The monastery flourished through the Renaissance and beyond.
It was suppressed during the Napoleonic era in the early 19th century (around 1808-1810), when many religious orders in Italy were dissolved and their properties confiscated.
The buildings were repurposed for various uses (e.g., parts were incorporated into the Casino Mediceo di San Marco, used for military purposes, or other civic functions).";FAUX

Founder: Blessed Giovanni Colombini of Siena (mid-14th century, c. 1360).General Characteristics of their Communities:

Urban Presence: They were often located in cities and towns, where they could minister to the sick and engage in preaching.
Hospitals/Hospices: Often associated with caring for the sick, so their houses might be near or run small hospitals/hospices.
Simple Buildings (initially): Reflecting their vow of poverty, their initial establishments were often modest, though some later acquired more substantial properties.
Distilleries: In their later period, many Jesuati houses became known for distilling ""aqua vitae"" or other spirits, which provided income.
Female Branch (""Poverine Ingesuate""): These were enclosed convents of nuns living a life of prayer, poverty, and manual labor.
Chari sm: Began as a lay penitential movement. They were known for:
Devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus (hence ""Jesuati"").
Strict poverty and an austere lifestyle (hence ""Poverine"" – little poor ones – in the Florentine church's name, often applied to their female branch or associated women).
Care for the sick, especially plague victims.
Public preaching, often with great fervor.
Living a life inspired by St. Jerome (hence their formal name).
Later, they became known for distilling and selling ""aqua vitae"" (spirits), sometimes for medicinal purposes, which also became a source of income.
Organization: Initially lay, they later received papal approval and were organized as an order of apostolic clerics. There was also a female branch (the Jesuati Nuns or ""Poverine Ingesuate"").
Suppression: The male branch of the Jesuati was suppressed by Pope Clement IX in 1668. The female branch continued for longer.
S. Girolamo delle Poverine Ingesuate in Florence:

Foundation: The Jesuati established themselves in Florence, and this church and convent were founded for them, likely in the late 14th or early 15th century, following the initial fervor of the order's founding. The ""Poverine"" part of the name specifically refers to the Jesuati nuns for whom the convent was primarily established.
Location: Situated in the Oltrarno district of Florence.
Medieval Activities of the Jesuati (and specifically the ""Poverine"" nuns) at this site:
Contemplative Life and Prayer: The nuns would have lived an enclosed life dedicated to prayer, including the Divine Office.
Manual Labor: As was common in nunneries, they would engage in manual labor suitable for their enclosed life, such as:
Textile work: Spinning, weaving, embroidery (perhaps producing items for the church or for sale).
Care of the sick within the convent.
Maintaining their convent and garden.
Devotion to St. Jerome: As their name suggests, a particular devotion to St. Jerome, known for his asceticism and scholarship.
Practice of Poverty: Living a simple and austere life.
The associated male Jesuati friars in Florence (who might have had a separate nearby house or provided chaplains) would have engaged in preaching, caring for the sick in the city, and possibly the production/sale of their distilled waters.

The abbey, dedicated to Saint Laurence, was founded in its present location during the reign of King Magnus VI of Norway (1263–1280). It was a house of Augustinian Canons. It appears however that this community was the one previously established as St. Olav's Abbey, Stavanger, one of the earliest Augustinian monasteries in Norway if not the very earliest. The exact date of its foundation is unknown, but it was well established by 1160.

At its height, up to 12 monks lived at Utstein, with twice as many lay people working on the building, doing the cooking, and doing the farming. The abbey owned extensive lands, and could feed about 250 people a year. It was dissolved in 1537 during the Reformation and was given in fee to Trond Ivarsson, a nobleman who served as local bailiff.";

Today only ruins of the monastery remain.

Originally a Kongsgård estate, King Sverre of Norway established a Knights Hospitaller abbey at Værne around 1200. The facility also served as hospital for the king's army until 1308, when King Haakon V established a hospital for this purpose at St Mary's Church, Oslo. Værne monastery was also a place of pilgrimage. The abbey was disestablished and placed under the crown in 1532. The buildings were burned down in 1570 in connection with the Northern Seven Years' War. The manor with adjacent farms was leased until 1675, when it was privatized. Later owners of Værne Kloster included Valentin Christian Wilhelm Sibbern, Georg Sibbern. The first antiquarian study of the ruins was made in 1812 by Lorentz Diderich Kluwer (1750- 1820). ærne Kloster, located near Moss in Østfold county, Norway, was indeed a significant Hospitaller establishment.

Here's what we know about it:

Hospitaller Commandery (Preceptory):

Værne Kloster was the main seat and most important commandery of the Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John of Jerusalem) in medieval Norway.
As with other Hospitaller houses, its primary function was to manage its estates and generate revenue to support the Order's activities, especially their military and charitable work in the Holy Land and later Rhodes/Malta.
Foundation:

It's believed to have been established around the end of the 12th century or very early 13th century (c. 1190s - 1210s).
King Sverre Sigurdsson is sometimes associated with its early history, possibly granting lands or privileges, though precise details of its founding can be debated by historians.
Importance and Function:

Administrative Center: Værne served as the administrative hub for any other smaller Hospitaller properties or interests in Norway.
Estate Management: It controlled substantial lands and farms, the income from which was vital.
Recruitment: It would have served as a point for Norwegians wishing to join the Order.
Hospitality: As the name ""Hospitaller"" implies, providing hospitality to travelers, especially those associated with the Order, would have been a function.
Spiritual Life: The knights and chaplains at Værne would have maintained a religious life according to the Order's rule, with a chapel for services.
Link to the Wider Order: It connected Norway to this powerful international military and religious organization.
The Reformation and Dissolution:

The Protestant Reformation reached Denmark-Norway in 1536-1537.
King Christian III dissolved Catholic religious orders and confiscated their properties.
Værne Kloster was secularized and became Crown property.
Later History:

After being taken by the Crown, Værne Kloster was often granted as a fief (len) to nobles.
Over time, it evolved into a large manor estate (herregård).
The original medieval buildings of the commandery would have been altered, repurposed, fallen into disrepair, or demolished.
What Remains Today:

The site of Værne Kloster is still known. The current main building on the estate is a manor house from a later period (e.g., 17th-18th century), but it stands on or near the site of the medieval commandery.
There are likely archaeological remains of the medieval Hospitaller buildings preserved underground.
The name ""Værne Kloster"" itself preserves the memory of its religious past.
Some historical sources and chronicles provide information about its operation during the medieval period.
So, while ""Varna Abbey"" might have been a slight misremembering of the name or a conflation with Varna in Bulgaria, Værne Kloster in Norway was definitely a significant Hospitaller center, playing a key role for the Order in that country. ";

On this date, Bishop Siboto of Augsburg acting as the curren ""Ordinarius"" confirmed the relocation of the convent, which was already considered a member of the Cistercian order. The convent had complete freedom from advocacy. Pope Innocent IV took the foundation under his protection in 1254 and recognized its exemption from the bishop of the diocese. In 1322/23 King Ludwig granted the convent complete freedom from duties and taxes as well as its own jurisdiction over its dependents, except criminals receiving capital punishment (Krausen, 75).

By the late thirteenth century, Quedlinburg had several advocates (McNamara, 269).;"4566 ; The community of Quedlinburg began as a foundation of the Margrave Gero for canons. Mathilda, the second wife and widow of King Heinrich, who acquired the site of Quedlinburg as part of her widow's property, established the community of female canonesses on this site. At the foundation of Quedlinburg, the rights and duties of the Liudolfing family were reduced in comparison to those of the king (Heineken, 62). The community was a free imperial house of canonesses, and Mathilda herself served in the community for thirty years. Her son, King Otto I, provided the congregation with a rich endowment of properties, granted the community immunities, and placed the congregation under imperial protection (Rienacker, 2). In 966, Otto I's own daughter, Mathilda was established as the first abbess. In 997 Mathilde also undertook governmental duties as guardian for her nephew Otto III. ; When Abbess Anna von Stolberg converted the community to the Lutheran reform, she required all the priests swear to Luther's Augsburg Confession. She also turned her Franciscan(?) monastery into an elementary school for both boys and girls. She continued to receive both imperial and papal privileges (Wiesner-Hanks, 17). The community had thirty-nine abbesses from its time of foundation to its dissolution in 1803. ; link to Frose, Wendhausen, Walbeck, and the Marienkloster of Munzenberg. ; Among the community's treasures are the ninth-century ""Samuel""-Evangeliar and a tenth century fragment of a Bible, known as the ""Quedlinburger Itala."" The Samuel Evangeliar is covered by a front cover of gold filigre and precious gems fashioned between 1225-1230 in Quedlinburg. Another Evangeliar, the Otto-Adelheid Evangeliar dates from the second half of the tenth century. ; Sisters In Arms: Catholic Nuns Through Two Millennia; ; Die Annales Quedlinburgenses; ; The community of Quedlinburg was closely connected to the Ottonian kings and the Holy Roman Emperors in general. Between 922 and 1207, Quedlinburg received 69 visits of German kings and emperors. Quedlinburg also served as a meeting place for numerous Reichstage and synods. The marriage of Otto I with Edith of England took place in Quedlinburg (Reinacker, 4). Both king Henry and queen Mathilda are buried in the church of Saint Servatius in Quedlinburg. Mathilda was honored as a saint of the community. ; Saint Mathilda (d. 968) Mathilda, born in 895, the second wife of the German king Henry I and his widow founded several monasteries, including Quedlinburg. Two vitae of Mathilda portray her as a model of royal holiness. In 966, Otto I's own daughter, Mathilda (to whom Widukind of Corvey's 'Res Gestae Saxonicae' was dedicated) was established as the first abbess (seeÂ [Letter to Matilda, abbess of Quedlinburg, undated],Â [Letter to Matilda, abbess of Quedlinburg, undated (2)],Â [Letter to Matilda, abbess of Quedlinburg, undated (3)]). In 997 Mathilda also undertook governmental duties as guardian for her nephew Otto III. The convent is famous for her strong leadership; she held a reforming synod for the German church at Dornberg and held an imperial diet at Quedlinburg in 984 (McNamara, 197). Abbess Adelheid I (999-1045) was the sister of Emperor Otto III. In 1212 Abbess Sophie allied with Otto of Brunswick versus her advocate, who supported Frederick II, and endured a siege of the convent (McNamara, 269). In 1220 the pope sent an order to the dependencies of Quedlinburg to obey the abbess (McNamara, 269). In 1223 Abbess Sophie was deposed by the Reichstag in Nordhausen and the advocate installed the prioress as the new abbess (McNamara, 269). Abbess Anna von Stolberg governed a sizable territory and was instrumental in converting the community to Protestantism in the 1540s. ; (uncertain) ; Quedlinburg served the high nobility as a place to send their daughters for education and care. ; Quedlinburg ; Quedlinburg ; The church of Saint Servatius underwent four building phases over the course of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Already by 936 there existed a small chapel constructed of three aisles (structure I). This was expanded by Queen Mathilde. The chapel was extended to the west; the eastern portion of the building lay a bit higher and served as the sanctuary and choir for the canonesses. This building (structure II) was completed circa 968. Another building phase took place under Abbess Mathilde (966-999). The church consisted of a three-aisled nave, which was consecrated in 1021 (structure III). Abbess Adelheid (999-1045) continued construction of this church, adding a crypt. Under this abbess the two western vaults were completed, along with the pillars which support them. She also was responsible for erecting the upper-level choir for the canonesses and the area of the main altar, where the sarcophgus for king Heinrich presumably was located. The buildings, however, succumbed to a fire in 1070. The church was rebuilt in the eleventh century and completed circa 1129 (structure IV). It is this fourth phase of building which still exists today; little of the previous structures are evident.Â Quedlinburg, S. ServatiusQuedlinburg, S. ServatiusÂ The eastern part of the choir was rebuilt in the Gothic style under Abbess Jutta von Kranichfeld circa 1320. The church has two towers on the West; of all the structures of Saint Servatius, it is these two towers which have been altered the most over the centuries. (Reinacker, 4-6). Twenty-two of the thirty-nine abbesses of the community were buried in the eastern portion of the church. In 1179 a church treasury was built into the northern arm of the church trancept. ; The northern wall of the entrance to the crypt has faint traces of paint, which indicate that it was previously painted with Biblical scenes. The capitals of the pillars of the church are carved with flowers, vines, human faces, and animals. Eagles, doves, lambs, and fish appear frequently in the iconography of the capitals. The crypt itself also retains traces of a painting depicting the judgement of Solomon and Susanna; these paintings date circa 1200 and were presumably commissioned by Abbess Agnes II (Reinacker, 14). The burial slabs for Abbesses Adelheid I (999-1045), Beatrix I (1045-1062), and Adelheid II (1062-1095) still exists and provide excellent examples of Romanesque sculpture. The life-size reliefs of the abbesses portray individuality in their portraits. A portion of the community's remarkable treasure is still extant. In the eleventh century, an inventory already recorded ninety-six objects in the community's treasury, most of which came as gifts from the imperial family (Reinacker, 18). During the course of the sixteenth century, financial difficulties caused many of the church treasures to be sold. The remaining treasury was transfered to Kassel in 1812 by King Jerome of Westfalia. Other treasures were lost during the Second World War, including two Evangeliars, a relic chest, 6 crystal jars, and a small reliquary cross. The treasures had been stolen by the american lieutenant Joe Tom Meador and sent back home to Whitewright, Texas. Ten of the missing objects were finally returned to Quedlinburg in 1992 (Reinacker, 19). Of the currently preserved treasury, the most important artifacts are three reliquaries of Saint Servatius, Saint Katharine, and Heinrich. All three consist of rectangular boxes covered in gold with filigre work and reliefs worked along the sides. The Servatius reliquary is decorated with a large amethyst as well. All three reliquaries date from circa 1200-1230, placing them within the abbacy of Agnes. The reliquary of Saint Servatius was in fact commissioned by Abbess Agnes and two reliefs along its side depic the abbess and provost Oderade. Other treasures include an ivory comb carved and decorated with precious stones, dating from the eigth century, a bishop's staff, and a large alabaster jar from the first century AD, reputedly used at the wedding at Canna. The jar was presented to the community as a gift from emperor Otto I at Easter in 973 (Reinacker, 26). A crystal reliquary from Egypt or Syria dates to the tenth century, donated by emperor Otto III. Perhaps the most famous treasure of the community is the tapestry depicting the marriage of Mercury and Philology, created circa 1200. The tapestry was presumably created in a neighboring workshop either in Halberstadt or Quedlinburg itself. Abbess Agnes II von Meissen was the patron of the work. ; Quedlinburg became the center of a small monastic empire with several dependent houses. The abbess of Quedlinburg was appointed by Henry I as abbess ofÂ GernrodeÂ and its dependency at Frose (McNamara, 198). Other dependent communities were Wendhausen, Walbeck, and the Marienkloster of Munzenberg. In 1220 the pope sent an order to the dependencies of Quedlinburg to obey the abbess (McNamara, 269). By the 1540s the abbess of Quedlinburg governed a sizable territory, including nine churches and two male monasteries (Wiesner-Hanks, 17). ; The convent of Quedlinburg was a powerful community. ; Only the church of Saint Servatius is still extant. ; The advocacy and protectorate of the convent was held by the nobles of Arnstein. The community was closely linked with the Liudolfing family (Heineken, 113). Later the city council of the city of Quedlinburg acquired from the bishop of Halberstadt the protectorate over the community (Heineken, 127) Quedlinburg Abbey (Stift Quedlinburg) – a house of Secular Canonesses, not cloistered nuns

1.  Foundation and Constitutional Status  
• 936 AD: Queen-dowager Mathilda († 968), widow of King Henry I (“the Fowler”), founded a memorial church and Frauenstift on the castle-hill at Quedlinburg (Saxony-Anhalt) for Henry’s soul and for the dynasty.  
• Confirmed by King Otto I in 936 and again in a royal diploma of 961 as a Reichsstift: immediately subject to the emperor, exempt from episcopal control, endowed with extensive lands in the Harz and northern Thuringia.  
• Headed by a Princess-Abbess (Fürstäbtissin) who sat in the Imperial Diet and ruled the small surrounding territory as a sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

2.  Secular Canonesses – what that meant  
• The inmates (canonissae or Damen) took no lifelong vows of poverty or enclosure; they followed a softened Rule of St Augustine, sang the Divine Office in choir, but kept personal property and could leave to marry.  
• Admission quickly became restricted to high nobility; by the 13th c. candidates had to prove 16 noble quarterings.  
• Each canoness received a prebend (income from estates), maintained her own apartment or half-timbered house inside the “Abtei-freiheit”, and had servants.  
• The community elected its own abbess and chapter officers (deaness, cellarer etc.) and employed secular priests for Mass.

3.  Early Political and Cultural Role (10th–11th c.)  
• With three early abbesses drawn from the imperial family—  
  – Abbess Mathilde II († 999), daughter of Otto I;  
  – Abbess Adelheid I († 1044), daughter of Otto II—  
  the house served as an Ottonian power-base in Saxony.  
• Produced the famous Annales Quedlinburgenses (covering 1008-1030), invaluable for early German history.  
• The scriptorium and treasury preserved masterpieces such as the Quedlinburg Ivories and Ottonian gospel books (many now in Berlin).

4.  Territory and Economy  
• About 40 villages, forests, silver mines near Goslar, market and mint rights in Quedlinburg town, tolls on the Bode river.  
• Annual income in the later Middle Ages was c. 4,000–5,000 Rhenish florins, enough to support 25–35 canonesses, 20 priests/clerks, and a garrison for the castle.  
• Conflicts: frequent feuds with the counts of Regenstein and with the growing burgher town of Quedlinburg, which strove to free itself from abbey overlordship.

5.  Reformation and Early-Modern Phase  
• 1539: Abbess Anna II of Stolberg embraced Lutheranism; the chapter became a Lutheran Damenstift yet kept imperial immediacy.  
• From 1540 the abbess shared territorial power with a Protestant town council; long lawsuits ended in a compromise (Recess of 1583).  
• 17th–18th c. abbesses were usually princesses from Protestant dynasties:  
  – Dorothea Sophia of Brandenburg (1610–1645)  
  – Anna Sophia of Mecklenburg (1645–1681)  
  – Sophie Albertine of Sweden (1704–1761)  
  – The last abbess: Anna Amalie of Prussia (1755–1802), sister of King Frederick II “the Great”.

6.  Dissolution  
• 1802/03: during the Napoleonic Reichsdeputationshauptschluss Quedlinburg was secularised and annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia.  
• Canons and servants received pensions; the abbey territory became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony.  
• Buildings on the castle-hill survived; the collegiate church of St Servatius now houses the world-famous Romanesque treasury.

7.  Surviving Heritage  
• Collegiate church St Servatii: three-aisled Romanesque basilica (mostly 1070-1129), crypt with Henry I and Queen Mathilda’s sarcophagi.  
• Abbey treasury (Domschatz): 5th- to 12th-c. goldsmith work, ivories, the Samuhel Gospels, the Heinrichskrug rock-crystal.  
• Quedlinburg’s old town and castle-hill form part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site “Collegiate Church, Castle and Old Town of Quedlinburg” (since 1994).

In sum: Quedlinburg was a prestigious imperial chapter of secular canonesses founded by the Ottonians, ruled by princess-abbesses, combining religious observance with worldly independence, and playing a notable role in medieval politics, scholarship and art until its secularisation in 1802.. Activities of the Secular Canonesses of Quedlinburg in the Middle Ages
(roughly 10th-15th centuries)

Because Quedlinburg was a Reichsstift of secular canonesses—i.e., well-born women bound by no perpetual vow of poverty or enclosure—their life combined religious observance with political, economic and cultural work that cloistered nuns could not perform.  The main spheres of activity were:

1. Liturgical & Memorial Duties  
• Eight daily Offices and conventual Mass were sung in the collegiate church of St Servatius.  
• Special memoria services every Monday for King Henry I and the Ottonian dynasty.  
• The canonesses paid vicars-choral and organists; some sisters themselves became noted chant-leaders (precentrix).  
• Feast-day processions through the castle precinct and (on St Servatius’ feast) into the town—visible reminders of princely authority.

2. Territorial Government  
• The princess-abbess wielded full comital jurisdiction over c. 40 villages, woods and silver-mines; she sat in the Imperial Diet from 1180 and issued charters under her own seal.  
• Canonesses formed her chapter-council, countersigning diplomas, hearing court cases (Hochgericht) and auditing manorial accounts.  
• They appointed vogts (bailiffs), foresters and mine-reeves, negotiated toll-exemptions for merchants, and concluded border treaties with the counts of Regenstein or Anhalt.

3. Estate & Financial Management  
• Each prebend (Pfründe) comprised rents from farms, vineyards and town houses; the canoness or her steward collected dues, saw to repairs, and lent seed-corn to tenants.  
• The community collectively ran:  
  – a royal mint (documented 994–1330);  
  – weekly and annual markets (charging stall fees);  
  – a customs station on the Bode bridge.  
• Surplus revenues financed building campaigns—e.g., the Romanesque rebuilding of the church (1070-1129) and new residence wings (c. 1300).

4. Cultural & Scholarly Work  
• Scriptorium produced and maintained a famous library: Annales Quedlinburgenses (1008-30), lectionaries, gospel books and chronicles.  
• Canonesses themselves often copied or corrected manuscripts; several hands are identifiable by initials “Q”.  
• The treasury accumulated ivories, enamels and reliquaries; sisters commissioned goldsmiths in Goslar and Cologne.  
• A school for young noble girls (schola puellarum) taught Latin reading, psalmody, account-keeping and occasionally Hebrew glosses for biblical study.

5. Diplomacy & High-Level Politics  
• Ottonian and Salian emperors lodged in the castle at Easter; the abbess organised diets (Hoftage), received papal legates and arbitrated disputes between Saxon lords.  
• Abbess Adelheid I (r. 999-1044) issued safe-conducts, witnessed imperial charters and once led a delegation to Rome.  
• During the Great Saxon Rebellion (c. 1073) the chapter hosted negotiations between Rudolf of Rheinfelden and Henry IV.  
• Repeatedly, abbesses acted as foster-mothers or guardians for imperial princesses (e.g., Sophia, daughter of Otto II).

6. Education & Courtly Culture  
• Younger canonesses trained in French, Latin and court etiquette; many later left to marry—taking knowledge and influence into secular principalities.  
• Quedlinburg became a literary centre for Minnesang; traveling poets (e.g., Heinrich von Veldeke) dedicated verses to its ladies.  
• Needlework and opus anglicanum embroidery for altar frontals were prized diplomatic gifts.

7. Charitable & Pastoral Outreach  
• Maintained the hospital of St Blaise outside the eastern gate, endowing eight sick-beds and a leprosy grant.  
• Distributed weekly dole of bread, beans and ale to the town poor; on Maundy Thursday the abbess washed the feet of thirteen widows and gave each a coin.  
• Supported parish priests in surrounding villages with liturgical vessels and books.

8. Military & Defensive Obligations  
• Though non-combatants, the abbess commanded a garrison.  The chapter funded the castle wall, armaments and contingent of 40 armoured men for imperial campaigns.  
• In sieges (e.g., 1115, 1319, 1477) the sisters organised storage of grain and supervised infirmary care for defenders.

9. Internal Social Life  
• Canonesses lived in separate houses (Klausen) around the cloister: each kept servants, horses, and sometimes a lap-dog—records list feed for seven “abbess’s greyhounds”.  
• Recreational hunting and falconry in abbey forests (allowed by a 1187 privilege).  
• Summer retreats to estate manor houses—documented at Gernrode and Ballenstedt.

10. Interaction with the Town  
• Frequent tensions: town council sought autonomy; canonesses defended tolls and judicial rights.  
• Yet joint projects existed: canalisation of the Bode, rebuilding of the market church St Benedict, funding the town walls (14th c.) when Hussite threat loomed.

Result
Throughout the Middle Ages Quedlinburg’s secular canonesses were far more than singers of the Office: they were territorial lords, estate managers, patrons of art and learning, political negotiators, and significant economic actors in central Germany—embodying a unique blend of religious life and worldly power that typified the great imperial Frauenstifte.";FAUX

In 1260 Heinrich transfered the villages of Ebersdorf and Frohnlach, which he held as a fief from the cathedral chapter, to the Bishop of Bamberg in order to establish a Cistercian convent with the abbess ofÂ Maidbronn. The bishop took the new convent into his protection and permitted the nuns certain rights to the wood in the forest where their convent was founded (Krausen, 94). (This led to friction with the cathedral chapter in later ages). In February the bishop of WÃ¼rzburg granted his approval of the foundation, giving the convent the name of campus solis, and confirming the privileges of the Cistercian order within it. In 1262 at the request of both bishops, the convent was formally incorporated within the Cistercian order (Krausen, 94). The duty of 'inspectio' was given to the abbots of Ebrach and Bildhausen. The convent was formally declared a daughter of Citeaux, but the abbot of Langheim acted as its spiritual supervisor and provided from his convent the father-confessor, provost, and conversi for the convent. Following a large fire in 1287 the convent was rebuilt in the village of HofstÃ¤dten, which the nuns obtained in exchange from the abbot of Saalfeld. In 1288 the abbess obtained lower jurisdictional authority over the convent's dependents form the counts of Henneberg. ; Repeated dispensations from the vow of abstinence show that the convent departed ever more radically from its original strict rule (Krausen, 95). In 1503 an internal dispute erupted in the convent over the newly-elected abbess Dorothea von Pfersfeld. Six 'unruly' nuns were placed in prison during this dispute. By 1524 the convent had a lutheran preacher, and by 1525/6 the convent had fallen into the prince's possession.

The church was built by the master builder Steinmetz Heinrich; between 1379-1407 a Konrad Parler is recorded as a stone-mason and builder. Konrad Parler was also the creator of the pair of knights carved in sandstone in the eastwall of the choir (Krausen, 95). The convent church was transformed into an evangelical parish church in 1540.

His wife, Adelheid, and his daughter, Elizabeth, agreed to this arrangement, and the document was witnessed by Walter of Klingenburg, his son-in-law (Hindsley, xviii). In exchange the nuns prayed in perpetuum for the soul of the founder, his ancestors, and his descendants. Ulrich also expected the nuns to accept unmarriageable daughters and to establish a working scriptorium (Hindsley, xviii). Over the years the convent received gifts of land and dowries from the nuns who entered. The first account book of the monastery, dating from 1312, mentions 175 properties in 54 locations. By 1350 the nuns had added 70 more farms and estates. By the end of the thirteenth century, the monastery possessed almost the entire valley of Hammerbach (Hindsley, xx). The convent also benefitted from bequeaths of land made by the nuns of the convent (for example Adelheid Langmann, see above in social composition). ; According to the community's sister-book, the initial community performed the agricultural labor themselves. They cut the corn, washed, baked, and performed all the daily chores. The beguines also cared for the sick and poor in the surrounding area (Hindsley, xviii).";"9507 ; Engeltal ; The Dominican monastery of Engelthal was based on a beguine community that formed around Adelheid Rotter in Nuremberg. The first community may alternately have belonged to the penitential order of S. Mary Magdalene. It was built on a site donated by Ulrich von KÃ¶nigstein auf Reicheneck in 1240 According to Hindsley, the convent's association with the Dominican order began soon after the election of Diemut of Gailenhausen as prioress; (she was elected on June 9, 1244) (Hindsley, xvii). The original group of women left Nuremberg when Emperor Frederick II was placed under interdict and excommunicated in April of 1240. They found protection from Ulrich II of KÃ¶nigstein, who allowed them to stay on his dairy farm at Engelschalksdorf near Swinach. The initial settlement was hard pressed to survive here, according to its Sister-book. The community followed the rule of S. Augustine and the statutes of the sisters of San Sisto in Rome. ; The nuns built a chapel dedicated to S. Lawrence. During the early fourteenth century Engeltal developed into a much renowned center of spirituality and learning. According to Hindsley, it was probably the foremost center of mystical life in Germany, if not all of Europe (Hindsley, xxi). In the late Middle Ages the community became lax and the nuns were known to ride for sport, and the clister garden was transformed into a stable. Several nuns even bore children. However, in the sixteenth century the nuns fromÂ S. KatharinenklosterÂ led a Dominican reform movement and reformed the house, along with several others (Hindsley, xxi). After this reform, the nuns strongly resisted the Protestant Reformation. However, in 1565 the community converted to the Protestant Reformation, after a reform attempt by the Dominican women of NÃ¼rnbergÂ S. KatharinenklosterÂ in 1513 failed. In 1565 the last two nuns of the convent transferred the cloister into the possession of the NÃ¼rnburg city council. In 1565 the last prioress, Anna Tucher, and the last nun, Ursula Zeissen, had to surrender the monastery and its extensive possessions to the city council. The revenues from the monastery enabled the city to establish a university at Altdorf (Hindsley, xxii). ; [1] [N2] cod. 1338, 66 fol., the Engeltal Sister-Book, in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuernberg ; By Women, For Women, About Women: The Sister-Books of Fourteenth Century Germany.Convent Chronicles: Women Writing about Women and Reform in the Late Middle Ages ; Der Nonne von Engeltal BÃ¼chlein von der Genaden Ãœberlast.

Other known inhabitants are: Adelheid von Trokkau, Diemut Ebnerin von NÃ¼rnberg, Anna von Weitersdorf, and Elsbeth Meieerin von NÃ¼rnberg. On May 28, 1350 King (later Emperor) Charles IV visited Engelthal and Christina Ebner. That same year, Johann II, the burgrave of Nuremberg, also came to vist her. Henry of NÃ¶rdlingen, the spiritual father and friend of Margaret Ebner also visited Christina Ebner in 1351 and introduced her to the teachings of Suso and Tauler. ; The Schenk family had at least seven family members who became nuns of Engelthal- Ursula Schenk of Geyern, Elsbet Schenk of Klingenburg, Anna, Elsbet, another Elsbet, Katharina, and Mari Schenk of Reicheneck, three of whom held the office of prioress a total of six times. In fact, the last Schenk of Reicheneck died in 1458, a nun of Engelthal (Hindsley, xx). ; The community of beguines cared for the sick and the poor of the surrounding area. Sometime between October 1241 and Easter of 1243 the beguines nursed Ulrich III, the grandson of their patron, Ulrich II. ; The papal expemtion the nuns procurred on October 10, 1248 guaranteed the nuns the properties they owned and freed them from interfernce by the noble families who had supported them (Hindsley, xix). The benefactors could thereby make no further claims on the rents or revenues from the lands they had previously donated. This led to numerous disputes between the monastery and those benefactors whose daughters had been admitted as nuns. The powerful Schenk family made numerous claims on the revenues of the monastic holdings (Hindsley, xx). Despite the papal bull the Schenk family continued to exact revenues from lands donated to the monastery. ; Rule of S. Augustine by 1248 ; The Sister-Book appears to indicate that this was a noble community; they drew from the landed nobility and gentry as well as patrician families from the city and families of the imperial or royal ministerial classes (Hindsley, xxi). The powerful Schenk family had at least seven female family members who entered Engelthal as nuns, three of whom became prioresses of the community. The community also drew several members from the city of Nuremberg. Christine Ebner, the author of the Sister-Book, was the daughter of a NÃ¼rnberg city aristocrat. She entered the convent at twelve and became a respected visionary. The Revelations of Adelheid Langman provide detailed information about the social composition of the convent. Adelheid, another famous nun of the community, was the widow of Gottfried Teufel. She received an estate at Happurg from her mother, Mechthild, a citizen of Nuremberg and the widow of Otto Langmann. On June 20, 1339 she purchased an estate at Traunfeld from Henry II Steinlinger from Lauterhofen. In 1350 Adelheid received revenues from a house in Offenhausen, from estates at Ittelshofen, Schmiede, Traunfeld, Happurg, Speikern, and a share in the revenues from another estate in Traunfeld. After Adelheid's death, revenues from Offenhausen were to be donated to the monastery to observe tha anniversary of the death of Sister Kunigunde of Forcheim. Also after her death the rents from Happurg and Speikern would fall to her neices, Gerhaus and Margarete Sachsen, both nuns of Engelthal (Hindsley, 51). Adelheid also states that her aunt dwelled in the convent and had received an office in the community. Her sister Sophia lived as a nun at Engelthal as well. She may also have been related to Elsbet mayer (her goddaughter) and to Gerhaus Mayer, with whom she shared revenues from an estate in Traunfeld. Kunigunde of Forchheim and Elisabeth of Eyb may also have been relatives. There also exists a possible relationship with Christina Ebner (Hindsley, 51). Adelheid lived uninterruptedly within the monastic enclosure from circa 1330 to her death on November 22, 1375. ; There may have been over 100 women, both choir nuns and lay sisters, in Engelthal. Their number became so great, it was necessary to found a daughter house. Despite the onslaught of the Protestant Reformation, in 1530 there were still 24 choir nuns in the convent. ; Engelthal; in the governmental district of Mittelfranken; in the administrative district of NÃ¼rnberg. ; The monastery buildings date from the second half of the thirteenth century. They are located across from the former chapel of S. Willibald, which was consecrated between 1057 and 1060. The monastic church was dedicated in 1265 to S. John the Baptist. The Sister-book mentions an earlier chapel dedicated to S. Lawrence. The monastery consisted of two cloisters, one connected to the chapel for the nuns and another for all the work buildings. The convent had a wall surrounding it with three towered gates, of which two remain (Hindsley, xx). The cloister church originally had a nuns choir, which was replaced with a balcony when the church was redecorated in the baroque style. ; In 1269, nuns from the community led by Mechthild Krumpsit began a new monastery at Frauenaurach,Â Frauenaurach.Â FrauenaurachÂ in turn prospered and founded the monastery ofÂ S. KatharinenklosterÂ in 1295. ; bayern.de/HDBG/ks/ksstart.htm ; The community produced a Sister-Book. ; Engeltal produced a Sister-Book written after 1328 and generally dated circa 1340, generally referred to as Der Nonne von Engeltal BÃ¼chlein von der Gnaden Uberlast. The book gives accounts of individual sisters of the community, listing fifty women, lay brothers and chaplains by name. The convent produced at least six distinct works: a Sister-book of Engelthal, the Vita of Sister Gertrud of Engelthal, the Revelations and Prayer of Adelheid Langmann, the Revelations and Biography of Christina Ebner, and the Gnaden-vita of Friedrich Sunder, chaplain at Engelthal. These text reveal the spiritual and visionary life of the nuns of Engelthal and also reveal their literacy. The nuns appear to have been familiar with the Bible, drawing imagery especially from the psalms and from Revelations. In addition, they reveal a familiarity with the sermons of Bernard of Clairvaux on the Song of Songs, the St. Trutperter Song of Songs, various versions of the Song of the Daughter of Zion, and The Flowing Light of the Godhead by Mechthild of Magdeburg. The convent may have originally had a significant library. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the nuns of Engelthal exercised a strong literary and spiritual influence. They particularly influenced the convents ofÂ PillenreuthÂ andÂ Inzigkoven. The Engelthal catalogue includes a manuscript on the sisters of Weiler, the sister-Book of Kirchberg, and a Sister-Book of a Dominican monastery near Ulm, all of which appear in Manuscript W (Hindsley, 188). ; The site of the monastic community was donated by Ulrich von KÃ¶nigsteim auf Reicheneck. The Schenk family served as patrons of the community and had numerous female relatives as nuns. ; Adelheid Rotter formed the first community of religious women; she had originally been in royal services and had accompanied princess Elizabeth from hungary to Thuringia in 1211 (Hindsley, xvii). She later gave up this 'sinful' life and began a life as a beguine in Nuremberg. ; The monastery buildings are still visible today, although they were rebuilt and redecorated in the baroque style during the sixteenth century. They presently serve as residences, garages, and storage facilities for farm equipment (Hindsley, xxii). ; The nuns originally came under the care of the Dominicans of Regensburg. However, in the inner life and administration of the convent the friars, chaplains and bishop played no role (Hindsley, xix). The sisters had the right to elect their own prioress and the bishop only served to confirm her election. The prioress, who had to be at least thirty years old, then chose her own subprioress and counselors (Hindsely, xix). Mechthild of Magdeburg's The Flowing Light of the Godhead influenced the writers of Engelthal through the connection between Mechthild and Christina Ebner through Henry of NÃ¶rdlingen, Ulrich of Kaisheim, the nuns of Maria Medingen in Dillingen, and the Freinds of God in Basel (Hindsley, 138). ; In 1339 Ludwig der Bayern placed the community under the protection of the NÃ¼rnberg magistrate. Kaiser Karl IV consulted with the visionary Christine Ebner in 1350. Christine Ebner's friendship with the priest Heinrich von NÃ¶rdlingen resulted in documented correspondence between the two from 1338 until circa 1356. ; lay brothers and chaplains are mentioned";FAUX

It is also certain that Pillenreuth possessed a description of Christina Ebner's life (Hindsley, 188). ; The women of this community were well connected with other convents and mystical circles. Presumably Henry of NÃ¶rdlingen played an important role in connecting the women of Pillenreuth with the nuns ofÂ Engelthal.

She specialized in copying books for the Divine Office (Ehrenschwendtner, 125). Only one illuminator of the convet is known: Barbara Gewichtmacherin (d. 1491).

The texts focused on translating and explaining the nuns' devotion to the Divine Service; prayers, sermons, meditations and tracts are prominent. Many texts forcus on the life and humanity of Jesus, as typical for female spirituality (Ehrenschwendtner, 126). Few works of academic theology appear in the convent's book lists. ; The nuns in the community produced many manuscripts which are still extant. See ""Manuscripts Produced or Commissioned"" ; The convent is famous for its library, not only due to the amount of books the nuns' possessed but also because the growth of their library can be traced historically. Many of the sources are still extant. Books owned by the convent prior to the reform in 1428 are more difficult to establish, but the lists record 46 books which were 'here before the reform.' (Ehrenschwendtner, 123). None of the earlier books appear to have been written by the nuns themselves. Two fifteenth-century book lists survive, listing the private books of the sisters and the convent's books and their convents. Two further lists record the table readings for 1429-31 and 1455-61 (Ehrenschwendtner, 123). By the end of the fifteenth century the convent possessed between 500-600 books (Ehrenschwendtner, 124). Many of the sisters had their own small private libraries within the convent. Some entered with their books; others compiled them after entrance (Ehrenschwendtner, 124). Sister Katharina Tucherin, the widow of a patrician, was equipped with twenty-four books when she entered the community (Ehrenschwendtner, 124). The convent lent its books to be copied. The convent also had a collection of convent chronicles in the library, describiing the lives of past sisters winth an emphasis on their religious and mystical experiences, and mostly written by fellow-sisters in the first half of the fourteenth century (Ehrenschwendtner, 129). The only extant manuscript from this collection is the convent chronicle of TÃ¶ss. In the fifteenth century the nuns worked as copyists. The names of thirty-two copyists have survived. The most important scriptrix was Kunigunde Niklasin (d. 1457), who copied thirty-one mansuscripts, including the entire Bible (Ehrenschwendtner, 125). As librarian, she also began to catalogue the convent's books. Another important copyist was sister Margareta Karthaeuserin, who was among the ten sisters from SchÃ¶nensteinbach sent to incorporate the convent into the Dominican reform movement. She specialized in copying books for the Divine Office (Ehrenschwendtner, 125). Novices and young sisters were specially trained as copyists as well as educated in singing, reading, and praying. However, the documents do not mention that they were taught Latin (Ehrenschwendtner, 126). Scriptrices were exempt from normal manual labour and had rooms of their own (Ehrenschwendtner, 125). Most of the books owned by the convent and nuns and read by them were in German. Some of the books are illuminated, but the illuminations were apparently not produced by the nuns themselves. Some of the books still include scraps of paper indicating the instructions for illumination to the painters (Ehrenschwendtner, 128). Out of all the books owned by the convent, however, only a few are illuminated. ; FrauenaurachÂ and by extension,Â Engelthal ; The community had close ties to the convent ofÂ S. Katharinental.

The house became the burial place for Riedag and his son, Karolo, as well as several other family members. Between 1064-1075, the community was reorganized with the advice and approval of Bishop Burchard of Halberstadt. Between 1064-1084 Bishop Friedrich brought it under the bishopric of Muenster. Spiritual supervision of the house was given to the bishop of Muenster. In 1118 the community changed to a Benedictine community under the influence of Margrave Conrad.

Pious women, who joined together into a life- and prayer-community circa 1186 under the leadership of the Countess of Dillinger, WÃ¼rga, from the family of S. Ulrich, settled in 1211 in SchÃ¶nenfeld by Augsburg (Wienand, 338). They placed themselves under the abbot of Kaisheim and requested incorporation in the Cistercian order. The foundation is attributed to Volkmar of Kemnat with the aid of Hartmann von Dillingen, bishop of Augsburg (see contributor's notes). The convent was originally founded on the ""Oberhof"" later the ""Weiherhof"" for Beguines. In 1211 the community received a formal unification, although it still lacked a definite rule. The first definite mention of the convent comes from a document of 1248 in which Pope Innocent IV promised the community the privileges of the Cistercian order (Krausen, 76-77). The convent's location was obtained by a gift from Volkmar of Kemnathen. In 1256 Volkmar was referred to as the founder of the convent. ; The nuns each managed their own household within the convent with their own servants (this would appear to negate a strict adherence to the Benedictine rule). During the course of the Thirty Years War the abbey was damaged and the nuns had to flee the cloister; they found refuge in the Castle Thurnfeld near Hall in Tirol (Krausen, 77). The convent was dissolved in 1803, but in 1836 the last six nuns were able to receive permission to reestablish the community from King Ludwig of Bavaria in 1836. In 1918 the convent was reestablished as an abbey (Wienand, 338). Among the abbey's ""subjects"" or ""vassals"" were the families of Mozart, Holbein, and Dossenberger. ; Further sources: Caviezel, A.

On July 22, 1351 Prioress Agens and the convent purchased a tithe in GÃ¶ggingen from Gertraud Otterin. Circa 1353 margravine Agnes bequeathed to the convent after her death: two farms in GÃ¶ggingen and Schwabeck in return for a Vigil and Mass to be held for her memorial yearly, she also provided for the wine and fish for the convent (on this occassion?); she provided further money for the celebration of memorials for her parents and relatives and for the king and queen of Hungary; she provided an annual allotment of 10 Shillings on Easter; she bestowed from a farm in Schwabeck for the provision of an eternal light for her grave rye, and other goods. She further appointed two nuns named Adelheid to serve as caretakers of her memorial, who should be replaced after their deaths by two more appointed by the prioress and convent. The use of a farm in Hiltenfingen fell to the two nun-caretakers and fell to the convent after their deaths. The nun-caretakers also recieved her cell in the dormitory and her chamber in the infirmary, which she had built at her own expense, as their dwellings and for their own use. She left her ""livingroom"" to the prioress. The chamber belonging to the caretakers should also be shared with any relative of Agnes' within the third degree who decided to enter the convent (HÃ¶rmann, 310-311). On July 14, 1355 the convent purchased two properties in Ober and Untermeitingen from Ulrich Kartinchen and on November 18 the convent purchased a farm in Hurlach from Gisela Welserin.

On October 27, 1416 the convent obtained freedom from feudal duties for a farm in WÃ¶rishofen from Duke Ulrich von Teck and purchased from Heinrich Schellenbold a farm (HÃ¶rmann, 315). On November 21, 1437 the convent purchased a farm property in Schwabmuenchen from Hartmann Ehinger of Ulm through its provost Stephan Hagenor. Under Prioress Afra the convnet purchased a farm in Schwabmuenchen from Ulrich Kinzelmann for approximately 1900 fl. Circa 1440 the Augsburg patrician Hans VÃ¶gelin bestowed a farm property and the advocacy of a fiefin Pliensprach for the two nuns Lucia and Afra Langenmantel, who were his sisters (HÃ¶rmann, 317). On August 28, 1454 the convent purchased a farm in Ropeltshausen from Georg von Ellerbach for 520 fl. and on February 5, 1457 it purchased a farm in Heudaorf from Wilhelm Schenk (HÃ¶rmann, 318). On October 9, 1461 the convent purchased a property from the abbot and convent of the Holy Cross in DonaruwÃ¶rth. On December 20, 1466 the convent purchased a farm property in Dillishausen from the abbot and convent of Irsee fro 275 Marks (HÃ¶rmann, 318). On January 20, 1486 the convent purchased a farm in Dillishausen from Erhard Eberhard. Prioress Elisabeth died on June 12, 1490 and bequeathed to the convent a perpetual tithe and other goods (HÃ¶rmann, 319). Under prioress Walter the convent purchased on October 4, 1490 pasture before the ""red gate"" from Jakob Rehlingen. Under prioress Welser and her predecessor Anna Walter (late fifteenth century), the convent purchased large tracts of land in and around Augsburg (Cuneo, 23). The convent was continually enriched through the bequests of its nuns, who were allowed to own their own property and goods. For example in 1495 the death of the nun Anna Riedler left the convent with a yearly tithe of 4 fl. in Ulm and a pasture in Lechhausen. On December 4, 1502 a memorial was established for Ulrich Walter, a citizen of Augsburg, his wife Barbara, Anna Walter (the prioresss) and Maria Walter, a nun at S. Katharina, with a choral Mass and vigil. In return, Walter gave the covent a green silk robe and two choir robes and a painting (HÃ¶rmann, 319). ; By the late fifteenth century, S. Katharine's was one of the wealthiest of the city's seven convents. S. Katherine's wealth and status was protected by various papal and royal privileges that had accrued to the convent since the thirteenth century. Despite Dominican rules, the nuns at S. Katherine's were allowed possession and control of personal items, properties, inheritances, gifts, and other sources of income (Cuneo, 23). In the late fourteenth century, despite the vast acquisitions of the convent, the income was not sufficient to cover the expenses of the nuns. ; In 1293 the convent forged an agreement with the community of GÃ¶ggingen for the rebuilding and repair of the Wertach-bridge and the yearly fee from it (HÃ¶rmann, 303).";"8958 ; Katherinenkloster; S. Katharina in Augsburg; S. Katherine's convent in Augsburg; S. Catharina ; In approximately 1230 a lay sisterhood formed a community just outside the city of Augsburg. This small community followed the Augustinian rule but adopted the Domincan rule under the direction of Pope Innocent IV in 1246 (Uhl, 59-60). According to HÃ¶rmann, the convent was originally founded in WÃ¶rishofe (HÃ¶rmann, 343). On August 5, 1251 Bishop Hartmann von Dillingen of Augsburg granted the community land in the parish of S. Moritz, where the nuns built a new cloister and church. ; The nuns of this community rejected absolute claustration. Despite their papal and royal protection, however, the community became the target of reform as early as 1357. Attempts at reform were undertaken by both religious and secular institutions in 1441 and 1485. According to a government document from 1441, the nuns defended themselves against workers hired by the city council to raise the convent walls and fasten window gratings. The nuns poked at the workers with roasting spits until the workers abandoned their efforts! (Cuneo, 23-4). Ironically, the Catholic nuns later were all but bodily dragged from behind the walls they had previously fought to keep permeable. Due to the nuns' determined resistence, the convent was not dissolved until 1802 (Cuneo, 24). ; On November 12, 1503 Prioress Anna received several relics for the church from Florian Waldruf von Waldenstein. She spent much of her own money on objects for the convent, leaving behind at her death paraments and furniture. ; Erinnerungen an das ehemalige Frauenkloster Katharina in AugsburgÂ The Basilica Cycle of Saint Katherine's Convent: Art and Female Community in Early-Renaissance AugsburgÂ Von Katherinenkloster zur Oberrealschule (Versuch eines baugeschichtlichen Ãœberblickes) ; The first documented prioress is named Gertrud, who appears in a document of sale from June 6, 1273. The second prioress was Agnes Sparerin, who presumably stemmed from the nobility of Langenmantel. The third prioress mentioned is Chrisitina, who appears in 1293. The next mention of a prioress occurs in 1297 with prioress Tuta or Guta. The prioress following Guta was Haedwig; then Elisabeth. Following Elisabeth was Gertrud, although it is unclear in which year she entered the position or for how long she presided as prioress. She was followed by Mechthild, whose rule lasted for three years. Her successor was Anna von Eggenthal, who appears in the documents of 1325 as prioress. Gertrud appears again after Anna (probably the same person as was prioress in 1321) in a document granting lands in WÃ¶rishofen to Heinrich Sinthmann and his four sisters in vassalage (HÃ¶rmann, 307). After three years, Anna von Rohrbach became the new prioress, then Gertrud became prioress for the third time. Prioress Anna von Pruggheim follows her; she was followed by Adelheid, who served as prioress for two years and appears in only one document of purchase in 1350. She was followed by Prioress Agnes, and then Adelheid appears again as prioress. In 1357, Adelheid Portner of Augsburg, a freind of countess Agnes, appears in the documents as prioress; she held this office several times, finally laying aside the office in 1369. She was followed by Agnes Rieder as prioress, who served in this office for four years and was then followed by Adelheid Portner again. She was followed by Elisabeth von Argon, a from Augsburg. She was followed by Prioress ""Anna."" In 1390 Elzbeth or Gisela appeared as the prioress; following her was Anna Dachs. Anna Dachs was followed by Anna Langenmantel, a daughter of an Augsburg patrician. There follows a gap in documentation; the next prioress is recorded as Katharina Langenmantel in 1424, although it is likely she became prioress prior to this date. She died in 1446. The following prioress was Anna Harscher (d. April 26, 1462). The next prioress was Afra Langenmantel. In 1444 the prioress was Anna Ilsung. She was followed by Helena Kastner as prioress, then Magdalena Ravensberger. Magdalena freely resigned her position and was followed by Helena Kastner again as prioress, who appears in 1464. She died on May 25, 1470 and was followed by Magdalena again. The next prioress was Anna Endorfer of Augsburg. She was followed by Elisabetha Haraus or Garaus on July 22, 1462. Elisabetha died on March 17, 1487 and was followed by Elisabeth of Egen or Argon. She was followed by Prioress Anna Walter; her sister oversaw the sexton's house (?). ; Income was derived from the convent's land, tithes, and taxes. Various large gifts in the years following the convent's establishment ensured the community a wide economic basis, which was increased through purchases of land both within and outside of Augsburg (Uhl, 60). ; On December 10, 1466 the episcopal court decreed that the convent must pay 14 fl. yearly to the priest of WÃ¶rishofen, which had been contested (HÃ¶rmann, 318). In 1479 a dispute arose between S. Katharina and Stern convent over a piece of property, the result of which the disputed land was judged to belong to both and similar pasture was recognized for each (HÃ¶rmann, 318). On March 29, 1481 a notarial document was produced for the mill in Diedorf which was also disputed. Prioress Elisabetha Haraus reached a settlement with the community of Biburg over a fishery and with the convent of Rottenbuch over a forest area in Mindelau (HÃ¶rmann, 318-319). ; Dominican ; According to Cuneo, the convent was an exclusive institution. A statistical study of the entries in the conent's necrology demonstrates that the nuns came from the wealthiest patrician and merchant families of Augsburg (Cuneo, 23). Cuneo concludes that the sisters of Saint Katherine's were a group of economically and socially powerful women, whose power was actively and repeatedly contested by secular and religious authorities under the guise of reform (Cuneo, 24). ; In 1294 it was decided that no more than 60 people should be accepted within the convent of S. Katharina. On June 5, 1445 Brother Martialis Auribele de Avenione, a professor of theology and master of the Dominican order decreed that the convent should not admit more than 47 nuns (HÃ¶rmann, 317). In the late fifteenth century there were 50 nuns. ; The convent lay in the southwest portion of the city in the ""Ulrichs-quarter."" ; S. Katherine's became the target of reform as early as 1357. Subsequent attempts at reform followed in 1441 and 1485. According to a government document from 1441, the nuns defended themselves against workers hired by the city council to raise the convent walls and fasten the window gratings, thereby imposing strict claustration upon the community. The nuns evidently poked at the workers with roasting spits so energetically that the workers abandoned their efforts! (Cuneo, 23-24). ; New Building projects were undertaken under the prioress Anna Walter. The Gothic church still exists.Â S. Katherine, Augsburg ; The convent is most famous for a series of six panel paintings, which were commissioned by nuns of the convent between 1499 and 1504 from some of the city's most prominent artists. The paintings were for the convent's new chapter hall. The paintings depict the seven basilicas of Rome and were used by the nuns as part of a spiritual pilgrimage for which they obtained papal indulgences (see papal exemption field). The paintings depict important women from sacred history as well as important pilgrimage churches. According to Cuneo, representations of women are unusual in Renaissance art; this displays the direct intervention of the donors (23). According to Cuneo, ""During a time when the convent experienced external pressures to reform, asserting the crucial role tht women played in sacred history became an empowering act of resistance and self-affirmation"" (21). The five nuns who commissioned the paintings were Dorothea Rehlinger, Anna Reidler, Barbara Reidler, Helena Rephonin, and Veronica Welser. The first painting in the cycle depicts the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, dedicated to the Virgin Mary; it was painted by Hans Holbein the Elder, commissioned by Dorothea Rehlinger, and was finished in 1499. The second painting of the cycle was painted by Hans Burgkmair and commissioned by Anna Reidler; it depicts the basilica of San Pietro. Barbara Riedler, perhaps the sister of Anna, commissioned Burgkmair to paint the third work in the cycle, the basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano, which was completed in 1502 (Cuneo, 21). The fourth painting, depicting the basilicas of San Lorenzo and San Sebastiano, was completed by an unknown artist in 1502. The last two paintings in the cycle, by Burgkmair and Holbein, were commissioned by Veronica Welser in 1504, the year she was elected prioress of the community. These panels depict the basilica of Santa Croce. The saints featured in the basilica cycle were significant to the nuns of Saint Katherine's. They included either saints related to the Dominican order and the convent, such as Mary Magdalene, the Virgin, and Saint Catheine, or patron saints of the donors, i.e. Helen, Dorothy, and Ursula. The other women depicted, Drusiana, Plantilla, and Thecla, were followers of saints John and Paul. According to Cuneo, ""Their representation in Renaissance art is unusual and probably indicates the direct intervention of the donors"" (23). In light of the convent's high social standing, economic power, and repeated conflicts with secular and religious authorities over the matter of reform, Cuneo interprets the convent's basilica cycle as ""an articulation of female community and as a justification of the Saint Katherine community in particular"" (24). ; The nuns conducted business affairs, mostly concerned with the management of their landholdings and properties and the manufacture of textiles. ; In 1348-1349 King Karl IV transferred the rights of patronage over the community to the city of Augsburg; this was later confirmed by Cardinal Peter in 1456. Saint Katherine's wealth and status was protected by various papal and royal privileges that accrued to the convent from the thirteenth century forward (Cuneo, 23). ; Saint Katherine's enjoyed significan freedom from ecclesiastical and secular authority. The nuns elected their own prioress and were not placed under the jurisdiction of the bishop (Cuneo, 23). ; On March 26, 1349 King Karl IV took the convent and its retainers into his protection and commissioned Friedrich, duke of Teck, and the municipal authorities of Augsburg to protect the convent in his name (HÃ¶rmann, 309). The nuns remained largely independent of city control by appointing their own personnel and administrators, through whom they managed their affairs (Cuneo, 23). On July 28, 1395 Bishop Burkart took S. Katherina into his protection in return receiving 20 fl. each year (HÃ¶rmann, 314). In 1434 King Sigmund confirmed all the privileges and freedoms bestowed on the convent by his predecessors. ; See Property/Assets";FAUX

In 1335, six virgins bought a house in order to live as pious Beguines and perform Christian works of mercy, such as caring for the sick. They called themselves the ""Sisters of Willing Poverty"" (Schwestern von der willigen Armut) according to Wienand (228). In 1394 they assumed the ule of S. Augustine from Bishop Burkhard von Ellerbach and were placed under the direction of the Dominicans. They then lived as Dominican Tertiaries. ; During the Reformation the convent was threatened with closure and the nuns moved to Dillingen until the bishop was able to secure their return (Wienand, 228). In 1695 the convent transferred to the second order of S. Dominic and discontinued their care of the sick. Stricter claustration was imposed at this time. In 1802 the convent was dissolved by the Bavarian government, but in 1828 King Ludwig I reestablished the convent and ordered that they care for the education of young women (Wienand, 229).

Gertrud gave her personal property for the provision of the abbey. In 1174 Bishop Hermann II confirmed the investiture of the abess as well as transferred the administration of the hospital to the cathedral deacon. In 1179 the convent was taken under papal protection under the papal legate Peter von Tusculum. The document recording this papal protection confirmed the convent in the Benedictine rule and the institutions of the Cistercian order (Krausen, 29). In 1182 the convent received letters of protection from Pope Lucius II and King Fredrich Barbarossa, which failed to name the nuns as adherents of the Cistercian order. It is likely that the convent, as with many other female Cistercian communities, never received formal incorporation. In the mid-fourteenth century the abbesses refered to the community as Benedictine. The hospital was last mentioned in 1296. ; another source: Wieland, M. Das Cistercienserinnenkloster St. Maria u.

On the spot of the burial, miracles began to appear. A chapel, the Heilig-Grab (holy grave) chapel, was established. In 1352 the Bamberg patrician Franz MÃ¼nzmeister expanded and furnished the chapel in memorial of his pilgrimage to Palestine. He also established a convent next to the church, into which Dominican nuns moved in 1356 (Wienand, 226). Franz MÃ¼nzmeister, a dweller in Bamberg, is regarded as the founder of the convent. However, Wilms states that the founder of the community was Wolfing von Stubenberg, bishop of Bamberg from 1304-1319. ; The convent was secularized then reestablished approximately one-hundred and twenty years later by the Dominican nuns fromÂ S.

The exact date of the foundation is contended. In 1206 Eberhard II of SchlÃ¼sselberg supposedly granted the location of Seppendorf in the valley of Ebrach for the foundation of a female Cistercian house. The earliest document of the convent's archives, dated to August 1, 1290, refers to the convent of ""Sluzzelowe"" by Eberhard's nephew Bishop Arnold of Bamberg, who completed the foundation after the death of his uncle (Krausen, 84). The bishop granted the nuns the location on which they were settled as well as all the rights and privileges of their order. From the beginning the convent stood under the protection of the bishop of Bamberg. The spiritual supervision of the convent belgonged to the abbot of Langheim. There is no documentary mention of the convent's formal incorporation into the Cistercian order. King Ludwig confirmed the convent's freedom from tithes in 1337; King Karl IV permitted the convent to freely elect its protector in 1356. Karl IV also confirmed the convent's freedom from tithes, taxes, and tolls (Krausen, 85). ; The peasant uprising of 1525 forced Abbess Ursula von Truppach to flee with the nuns to thier farm in Jakobsberg near Bamberg. The cloister was heavily damaged and her successor, Brigitta von Stiebar tried to rebuild the church and cloister. Plundering and damage took its toll on the convent again in 1553 when Margrave Albrecht Alkibiades of Brandenburg engaged in a feud with the Bishop of Bamberg (Krausen, 85).

The chronicle of the community dates from 1595, written by Heinrich Eggeling. The community was originally founded as a male house. In 1243 the widowed Duchess Agnes von Meissen, widow of Heinrich, count-palantine of the Rhine, received possessions in Alt-Isenhagen from her nephew, Duke Otto von Braunschweig, in order to found a Cistercian monestary. The monks for this new foundation were drawn from the monastery of Riddagshausen, and the new foundation was undertaken by the abbot of Riddagshausen. Early documents show many donations and gifts, so that the convent was presumably well-endowed upon its establishment. In 1259 the buildings burned, and the monks abandoned the location. They moved to the convent of Marienrode at the request of the Bishop Johann von Hildesheim, which had previously been occupied by Augustinian canons (Riggert). Women assumed possession of the location under the initiative of the bishop of Hildesheim; this was also supported by the Abbot of Riddagshausen. The first documentary mention of the female house is in March 16, 1265 (Riggert). The nuns were probably drawn from the neighboring convents of eitherÂ WienhausenÂ orÂ WÃ¶ltingerodeÂ in Goslar. The community moved twice. On March 12, 1327 Bishop Otto von Hildesheim gave the community permission to move to HankensbÃ¼ttel. It acquired this location through purchase and was established here by 1329/30 (Riggert). Although it is unclear why the convent moved location, poor economic conditions were a likely factor (Riggert). Hoogeweg and Appuhn state that the convent burned in 1336, causing the nuns to move again(Hoogeweg, 73; Appuhn, 13). After the fire the nuns were forced to rely on alms (they engaged in Brandbettel/""fire-begging"") (Riggert). In 1346 the convent moved to its present location (Neu-Isenhagen) under Bishop Erich von Hildesheim. According to one of the convent's documents, the convent again moved due to busy traffic on the trade routes which disturbed the nuns in their spiritual duties. The community especially objected to the music and noise on feastdays which disturbed the nuns' spiritual duties (Riggert). The convent lay on one of the important trade routes between the north and south and probably was plagued with numerous pilgrims seeking refuge within its walls as well. Not desiring to take on such duties, the convent was transferred. The new buildings remained unfinished due to the advent of the plague and the LÃ¼neburg succession war. In 1385 the convent was destroyed by a both of lightening and was rebuilt. The convent probably followed the Benedictine rule and Cistercian customs. Although it considered itself Cistercian, it was never formally incorporated into the order (Riggert). ; In the fifteenth century the convent undertook an internal reform, as did many other convents in the dukedom of LÃ¼neburg. In 1488 this reform was complete. The convent later accepted the Lutheran Reformation after substantial resistance (from 1529-1541). The first protestant abbess was Judith von BÃ¼low (Riggert). ; More research is necessary on the economic aspects of this community. ; The archives for this community are located in the LÃ¼neburger KlÃ¶sterarchive at Wienhausen. ; Die Luneburger FrauenklosterÂ Verzeichnis der Stifter und KlÃ¶ster Niedersachsens vor der ReformationÂ Kloster Isenhagen: Kunst und Kult im Mittelalter ; [1]Geschichte des Dioez. und der Stadt Hildesheim II, p. 200.

The first nuns came from the Cistercian convent of Wolmirstedt in the diocese of Magdeburg. There were four: Clementa, Floria, Antonia, and Zacharia (Riggert). In 1234 the convent was established unsuccessfully at HÃ¶hbeck; it then moved to the district of LÃ¼chow-Dannenburg, where it found support from a noble widow (Riggert). In 1237 the convent moved to Bohndorf (in the district of Uelzen today). According to tradition, the community moved from place to place for nine years. In 1241 a knight from Meding, Marshal of the LÃ¼neburg dukedom, gave the community permission to settle on the ancestral seat of the family (today Altenmedingen). According to Hoogeweg, he provided them with a vacant location in Alt-Medingen, built a dwelling here and provided the village church, to which the nuns' transferred in 1240 (Hoogeweg, 91). It is unclear whether the community was a family foundation of the knights from Meding (Riggert). In 1323 the community purchased the village of Zellensen from the noble family of Grote (today Medingen bei Bad Bevensen). In 1333 the community moved here with the permission of the bishop and cathedral chapter of Verden (Riggert). The reasons given for the move were: the lack of running water, the lack of wood, a mil, constant noise in the Heerstrasse, and the threat of robbers and arsons! (Riggert). In 1336 it transferred again to its present location, and the church was consecrated in 1337. The convent followed the Benedictine Rule and Cistercian customs, although it was not formally incorporated into the order (Riggert). The community was founded as a priory, but in 1494 it was transformed into an abbey. ; The extant illustrated manuscripts are held in Kopenhagen's KÃ¶nigliche Bibliothek (Royal Library) Ms.G.K.S. 3451, MS.

These works appear to have been made by the nuns themselves, on the basis of their artistic ""naitivity"" and internal evidence. The motif of the Arisen Christ appears frequently in the manuscripts, as do images of King David and the Virgin Mary. Most of the illustration consists of decorated initials and borders. The images depicted may have drawn their iconography from personal devotional images and tapestries produced in the region (Uhde-Stahl, 35-37). Most of the manuscripts date from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Among the most beautiful is an illustrated Psalter (Hildesheim Cathedral library Ms. J. 27 (HI3). This is the only manuscript that specifically mentions the date, place, and name of the producer; it was made in 1478 by Elisabeth von Winsen in Medingen, under Provost Tilemann de Bavenstede. Elisabeth both copied and illustrated the work (Uhde-Stahl, 33). An image of Christ appearing to two youths at the sea of Genezareth in Medingener Ms. J. 29 (HI1) apparently drew iconographically from the paintings in the nuns' choir atÂ Wienhausen, displaying a further connection between the two houses. An antependium from the community, created circa 1450, is preserved in the Kestner Museum in Hannover.Â Medingen AntependiumÂ The antependium depicts the crucified Christ, surrounded by Old Testament prophets and the disciples. At the bottom of the antependium are scenes of the nativity and Christ emerging from his sarcophagus. Four large medallions appear on each side of the antependium. The two on the left-hand side depict the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus and the angel Gabriel. A nun climbs the ladder leading up to the crucified Christ.Â Medingen antependium(detail) ; The images of the nuns portrayed in the illustrated manuscripts give some indication of the nuns' habit and how it changed with the reform of 1479. In works dating prior to 1479 the nuns are depicted with a round veil over a crown and with a red cross on the forehead, as inÂ Wienhausen, Cistercian nun with Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim. In works dating to after 1479 the veils are depicted as pointed (Uhde-Stahl, 44-45). ; The entire library of the convent burned in 1781; however, several illustrated manuscripts are still extant. Internal evidence, such as depictions of nuns in Cistercian habits and a reference to a nun (in Manuscript HI3) as scribe and illustrator, indicate that the nuns were active in copying and illustrating manuscripts (Uhde-Stahl, 31). ; The Welf family acted as patrons of the community. The provost Ludolf von LÃ¼neburg, an illegitimate son of Duke Otto, also was a patron of the community (Riggert). ; The first nuns came from the Cistercian convent of Wolmirstedt in the diocese of Magdeburg.

By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the convent's aquisition of land halted. The convent primarily held property in and around the city of Braunschweig. In 1245/49 the convent held 22 hides, a farm, and a parish in the west half of the city. In 1256 the ministry official Bertram ""the elder"" von Veltheim gave the convent four hides in Gevensleben free from advocacy on the occassion of the profession of his two daughters (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 70). In the fourteenth century the convent acquired three mills, and a portion in the Lueneburger saltworks, as well as a fish-farm(?) (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 71). In 1370 Duke Magnus II declared that in the future no knight or princely advocate could take food or feed from the convent or its farms (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 71). The convent also held possessions in the areas of Lamme and in Lehndorf (in the city of Braunschweig) on the Heerstrasse toward Hannover; it had important possessions in Wedtlenstedt (in 1270-1284: 19 hides, 8 farms) and Zweidorf (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 82). In Welkeleghe the convent had two hides in 1271 which were sold in 1319. In 1329 it had rights over the forest in Dutzem; in 1355 it had four hides in this location (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 82-3). The convent also had possessions in Bortfeld ( in 1312 five and a half hides and farms), in Voelkenrode, and Wendeburg. In 1269 the convent held three hides in Denstorf. In Lamme in 1315 the convent held two farms, four hides and their dependents, and in 1322 it received rents from three hides. In 1343 the convent records six hides in Vallstedt; in Sonnenberg from 1379-1756 it held five hides and a farm. In the area of the city of Salzgitter, the convent held two hides in 1254 in Lobmachtersen, and in 1309 income from two hides. In 1283 it held a hide in Watenstedt, and from 1448-1753 the convent received tithes from two farms in Heerte. In the area of WolfenbÃ¼ttel the convent also held property. In Weferlingen it held four hides in 1268, two farms and seven hides in 1331. In Evessen the convent held from 1395-1423 a portion of the income of the knightly farms (nine hides) for the Mary-Magdalene altar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 83). In Watzum south of Schoeppenstedt it held three hides in 1262 and four and a half hides, two farms, and fields in 1312. In Bisdorf on the Flur Barnstorf the convent held a hide in 1285 and two hides and two 'areas' in 1314. In Achim the convent had two hides in 1297 which it sold in 1355 to the convent of Neuwerk in Goslar. From 1359-1361 the convent had ten hides in Klein Biewende, and from 1365-1373 it had a farm with one and a half hides in Berklingen. In Wetzleben the convent held three hides from 1387-1389. In Gevensleben am Heeseberg the convent possessed twenty and a half hides from 1256-1343. In 1282 it acquired seven and a half hides here. In 1358 it recieved taxes from a farm with a half a hide. In Volkmardorf between Neubrueck and Didderse the convent held two hides bestowed by Duke Albrecht. In Rethem an the Aller west of Celle the convent held five hides, a farm, and a forest complex in 1301 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 84). In the fifteenth century the convent suffered under the alienation of some of its property. In 1432 certain possessions were ordered to be returned to the canons of S. Cyriacus by Pope Eugen IV (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 72). Nevertheless, the convent was able to retain much of its landed possessions up to the present day (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 81). The convent had mills in Weferlingen in 1270 and 1331, in SchÃ¶ppenstedt in 1309, a windmill in Braunschweig in 1310, and a water mill in Wahle from 1335-1584 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 84-5). The convent also received fees from the mills in Braunschweig, Eitzum, Lobmachtersen, and Erkerode. The convent possessed half of the fishing area in the Oker from the 'door of Peter' in Braunschweig to the ""Pfahldorf"" Oelper. In 1365 the convent acquired a portion in the LÃ¼neburg saltworks from the Benedictine monastery of S. Michaelis in LÃ¼neburg.";"9409 ; Conventus sancte crucis in Rennelberch; Sancte crucis claustro quasi in preurbio civitatis Bruneswic sito (1254); Coenobium montis cursorum;S. Crucis; Kreuzkloster vor dem Petritor; Kreuzstift auf dem Rennelberg, in Monte cursorum ; The convent was founded circa 1230 within the city of Braunschweig on the site of a previously mentioned foundation, known as ""mons cursorum Rennelberg"" in the western part of Braunschweig on the Heerstrasse towards Celle. According to the foundation legend, three pious women lived in claustration in Rennelberg. Next to their dwelling a cross-shaped tree grew, under whose shadows many miracles occurred. The knight Balduin von Campe founded a convent here after the resolution of a conflict with the city of Braunschweig. The convent church was dedicated in 1230 by Bishop Konrad II of Hildesheim (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 68). According to tradition, the convent was founded as a Benedictine community (circa 1230-1409). The convent assumed Cistercian rules in the fifteenth century (circa 1409-1545) (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 69). It appears that the abbesses asserted that the nunnery was part of the Cistercian order, whereas the ecclesiastical hierarchy did not acknowledge this. It is likely that Heiligen Kreuz was one of the many nunneries which followed Cistercian customs without being officially integrated within the order (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 69). In 1409 the nunnery was officially accepted into the Cistercian order. The community remained Cistercian until 1545. ; The convent flourished both economically and artistically in the fourteenth century. The convent appears not to have experienced any special deprivations or suffering during the plague. In 1340 the convent suffered, like all others within the bishopric of Hildesheim, under the papal bann during the conflict between Heinrich and Erich over the bishopric of Hildesheim (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 72). The internal reform of 1469/70 which affected many of the LÃ¼neburger convents appears not to have affected Heiligen Kreuz. It is uncler whether the refomer Nikolaus von Kues, who spent several days in 1451 in Braunschweig, actually made a visitation at the convent. The provost Dietrich belonged to those clerics imprisoned by Kues (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 72). The convent appears not to have been affected by the difficult plague years of 1460, 1463-4, 1473 and 1496. In 1528 the convent accepted the Lutheran Reformation. The convent was burned in 1545 and the remaining nuns were placed in the Benedictine monastery of S. Aegidien (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 76). ; In 1284 Bishop Peter von Magdeburg gave the convent an arm-reliquary of S. Barbara (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 71). The convent also recieved a reliquary of the Holy Blood from the monastery of Cismar in 1283. ; The only surviving manuscript is the ""Chronica et Memorabilia monasterii S. Crucis extra muros civitatis Brunsvicensium,"" which records the histroy of the convent from 1485-1506. It is located in the Herzog August library in WolfenbÃ¼ttel, #1159. One literary work from the convent remains: a Liber ordinar. for the Cistercian order, dating to the fifteenth century, located in the University library in GÃ¶ttingen, #Theol. 206.

Abbess Mechtild (Mathilde) von Vechelde, elected abbess at forty years old, promoted the rennovation and new creations in the convent church and nuns' choir. ; The oldest document concerning economic matters dates from 1241 and records a lease with the provost of the Braunschweig canon's college foundation of S. Blasii of fields and fifteen gardens for three pounds of silver yearly and an interest of twenty-four Marks (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 81). In 1284 the convent acquired patronage over the church and the Augustinian canons of Katlenburg (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 82). The convent recieved tithes in Zweidorf (in 1252 half a tithe, sold in 1319) In Wedtlenstedt (the whole tithe from 1314-1771) and in Abbenrode (from 1403-1775 the whole tithe). In Immenrode in recieved half of the tithe from 1265-1770. The convent recieved tithes from Weferlingen (1270-1767), Bistorf (1285-1315), Neindorf am Oesel (after 1314-1765), Kraut Neindorf on the Flur GroÃŸ Biewende (1374-1770), and Hedeper (in 1474 three fourths of the tithe) (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 84). In 1245/49 the convent received patronage over the church of the Holy Cross in Lehndorf from the ministry official, Johann von Wahle (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 85). The convent also acquired patronage in the church of Wedtlenstedt from the Augustinian canons of Katlenburg in 1284. The convent required a dowry from each women admitted to the convent (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 87). ; In 1266 the nunnery came into conflict with the Augustinian canons of Oelsburg by Peine and the archdeacon of Denstorf over the convent's attempt to expand to the west. In 1270 Heiligen Kreuz became involved in a seventeen year conflict with the Augustinian canons of Katlenburg over a gift in Wedtlenstedt. In 1287 the conflict was settled in favor of the convent (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 70). From 1272 to 1279 the nunnery became involved in a conflict with Bishop Otto I of Hildesheim about a contribution to the diocese. In 1256 Pope Alexander IV had exempted all churches, convents, and chapels from such contributions. (The city was divided between the bishopric of Halberstadt and Hildesheim). When the convent refused to pay, the bishop excommunicated it. ; Benedictine ; The nuns stemmed from the local bourgeousie and patrician families, especially those connected to the city council and with the ducal ministry. The names of several families appear frequently. These are: Bleckenstede, Breier, Broistede, Broitzem, Damme, Doring, Elers, Heyde, Holle, Holtnicker, Hondelage, Kerkhove, Less, Luckenem, Lutherdesvon Barberge, Pawel, Salge, Scheppenstede, de Septem, Turrem, Twedorp, Ursleve, Vechelde, Velstede (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 86). ; In 1350 there were twenty-three nuns. In 1506 there were thirty nuns and an abbess. In 1532 after the departure of ten nuns, fourteen nuns remained with the abbess. In 1545 there were six nuns and fourteen novices. According to RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, the convent held betwen thirty and forty nuns prior to the Reformation along with ten lay sisters (87). ; In the principality of Saxony; 1235 in the principality of Braunschweig-Luenburg. It was located on the site of a previously mentioned foundation, known as ""mons cursorum Rennelberg"" in the western part of Braunschweig on the Heerstrasse towards Celle. ; In 1503 Cardinal Raimund Peraudi, bishop of Gurk, celebrated a Mass in the convent and mentioned the nuns as remaining true to the Cistercian rules. ; The convent church was presumably completed in the thirteenth century. It was probably dedicated in 1230, 1250 at the latest; in 1271 a Nicholas-altar is mentioned. Documents mention the cloister, a garden, a kitchen, and outbuildings (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 91). Besides the main altar, six other altars are mentioned in the church. The altars were dedicated to Mary, the Holy Blood, Mary Magdalene, the angels, the apostles, and to S. Nicholas. These altars were erected by patrons of the community (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 91). In 1359 a chapel dedicated to the holy apostle Jacob was dedicated by the parents of Conrad von Weferlingen; a second chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross was erected through the testament of the patrician, Juergen Holtnicker. A family chapel was erected according to the testament of Henning von Adenstedt. The convent was burned in the fall of 1545. In 1567 the city-council decided to rebuild the convent in a Renaissance style; this building was burned in December 1605 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 91). ; Abbess Mechtild (Mathilde) von Vechelde, elected abbess at forty years old, promoted the rennovation and new creations in the convent church and nuns' choir. In 1494 she gave eight Marks for a new tabernacle for the statue of Mary; in 1495 a new reliquary-shrine was commissioned for thirty-five (florins?). In 1505 the nuns' choir received new carved choir stools and in 1414 an organ is mentioned (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 92). From the medieval possessions of the convent only a crucifix; a wooden, painted shrine; a silver and gold chalice, and a box for the Host remain. Portions of six wool tapestries also survive from the first half of the fourteenth century. The themes of the tapestries include the story of Parzifal, the story of Solomon and the queen of Sheba, Moses, the Prophets, and a tapestry with a pelican motif and another with a lion motif (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 93). ; The convents' documents record an abbess, prioress, celleraria, sacrista, cameraria, cantrix, subcantrix, infirmaria, and a scholastica. The regulations for the election of an abbess required that the candidate be thirty years old, descended from a legitimate marriage, and have spent five years in the convent after her profession (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 86). The induction of the abbess was the task of the bishop of Hildesheim, but he generally delegated it to the abbot of the Benedictine convent of S. Aegidien (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 86). ; The convent must have had a library and a scriptorium according to RÃ¶mer-Johannsen. The only surviving manuscript is the ""Chronica et Memorabilia monasterii S. Crucis extra muros civitatis Brunsvicensium,"" which records the histroy of the convent from 1485-1506.

The convent was rebuilt in 1567 and burned again in 1605. It was finally destroyed on October 14-15, 1944 by fire bombs. Only a few buildings remain from the sixteenth-century structure. ; The convent appears to have had ties to the Cistercian nunnery of Abbenrode (founded 1252), because in 1254 the provost, abbess and convent of Abbenrode paid twenty Marks silver through the convent of Heiligen Kreuz in order to no longer be burdened with the assumption of nuns (receptione dominarum) (RÃ¶mer-Johnnsen, 69). The convent also had a close tie with the Benedictine monastery of S. Aegidien. ; The convent had close relations with the city and council of Braunschweig. The convent had good relations with the duke of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg, but suffered frequently from damages and plundering of the ducal armies in the many conflicts between the city and the duke (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 70). In 1417 the convent loaned the city 130 florins(?) to support the city in its conflict with the canons of S. Blasii before the council in Constance (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 73). In 1492 the convent came into a conflict between the city and Duke Heinrich, and the nuns had to flee to the city-farm of Riddagshausen (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 73). In the course of the dispute the duke destroyed the convent possessions in Lehndorf and Raffturm and damaged the convent villages of Lamme and Wedtlenstedt (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 73). ; The convent was placed under the supervision of a provost. In 1318 there were three chaplains (a chaplain, vicar, and scholar), in 1410 four and in 1490 three again. The first chaplain was the father confessor for the nuns. The convent also records a sacristan, a doorman, and a teacher (school-man) underneath the provost (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 89). A manager (Provisor) oversaw the provost and controlled his management of the convent's property. The convent also had a farm-manager. Free servants and maids worked the convent farms (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 90).";FAUX

The parish of Kitzingen was incorporated into the convent at this time (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 562). In 1284 Pope Martin IV ordered the provost of Bamberg to secure the convent's alienated property for the convent again. It is likely this property was alienated under the protectorate of Friedrich of Hohenlohe. Hospital .  Bishop Heinrich allowed the nuns to eat meat as well as change their habits from white to black. During this period the convent had grown lax and Bishop Otto of Bamberg reestablished order within the community (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 561).";"6445 ; This community was founded in the mid-eighth century as a chapter of canonesses. In the beginning of the eleventh century (after 1007) the foundation was renewed or reformed(?) as a Benedictine abbey. The convent was reputedly founded by Boniface as part of his missionary activity among the Germans. According toÂ Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., it was among the first female houses founded by Boniface in Germany (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 526). The convent of Lioba may have suffered from decline (as many other houses founded by Boniface did), resulting in its renewal in the eleventh century. In 828 King Ludwig decreed the reform of the convent by the bishop (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 561). Under the abbecy of Bertha (III) (c. 1108) Bishop Heinrich allowed the nuns to eat meat as well as change their habits from white to black. During this period the convent had grown lax and Bishop Otto of Bamberg reestablished order within the community (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 561). ; Circa 1360 Bishop Albert ordered the nuns of Kitzingen to restore the administrative duties, which they had taken away from Abbess Anna, under the threat of excommunication (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg.,563. The convent had the privilege of granting criminals protection within its walls (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg.,564. In 1544 the convent was transformed into an evangelical women's chapter by the Margrave of Brandenburg. ; The Library in Trivulz. in Milan contains a twelfth-century Breviary from this community, #263 (Cat.

She was followed by Abbess Magdalena of Leonrod, 1474; Margarethe TruchfeÃŸ (?) of Baldersheim, 1492; Elisabeth of Finsterloh, 1520; Katharina of Fronhofen in 1522; Amalia from the family of Kolben from 1529-1541; and Veronika Hund of Saulheim from 1542-1544. ; In 1345 a hospital was reestablished in conjunction with (?) the convent. In addition to the sisters within the convent, there were hospital sisters. A few of the recorded hospital sisters are: Kunigunde of Giechen, Adelheid of Bruneck, Elisabeth of Bruneck, Kunigunde of Steyne, Agnes of Paris, Christine of Wiesenthau, Margareth of Strytberg, Adelheid of Wundeck, Elsbeth of Frankenstein, and Anna of Heydeck (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 564). ; Benedictine (by the eleventh century) ; In the governmental district of Unterfranken. ; In 1484 the convent was almost completely destroyed by fire. ; The likeness of Abbess Magdalena of Leonrod (1474) once existed in the cloister. ; According toÂ Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., nuns from the convent of Kitzingen also dwelled in a cell a quarter-hour from the village of Kaltensondheim. The nuns were supported in food and other materials from the convent (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 611). (The existence of this cell requires further verification). ; The history of this convent appears rather sketchy and requires further verification. Several of the manuscript sources held in WÃ¼rzburg contain economic information from this house. ; According toÂ Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., during the abbecy of S. Thekla the convent engaged in the production of books, although no formal documentation of this activity exists.Â Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg.Â also speculates that the convent had a library (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 550-551). ; In the eighth century Habbert and Hraud of Geldersheim divided their property in half, donating half to Fulda and the other half to Kitzingen (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 560). At the request of the Counts of Henneberg and Castell, the abbess was permitted to enjoy the income of the convent's parishes for two years, since the convent had suffered economically from wars (in the mid-thirteenth century). ; S. Leoba was one of the first members of the community (seeÂ Life of Leoba.) She is credited with the miracle of stopping a fire and saving the convent from burning to the ground. On another occasion she is credited with a healing miracle whereby she cures a sick nun who was believed already dead (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 532-533). Others mentioned among the founding members of the community are Williswind, Agathe, Eoliba, and Nana. It is unknown whether the earliest members of the community came from England or from among the Franks. ; The convent perhaps had ties with another,Â Bischofsheim, which was likely destroyed by the Saxons (? although it was not dissolved until 1802?). Abbess Sophie of Neuburg turned to Abbess HildegardÂ RupertsbergÂ to aid in the reformation of Kitzingen. Abbess Hildegard sent her a mystical work and in 1156 visited the convent herself, where she gave a sermon in the marketplace (Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg., 562). ; Abbess Sophie of Neuburg was taken into the protection of King Konrad III against renegade knights. King Friedrich I attempted to bring better order to the convent in the mid-twelfth century along with the bishops of Bamberg and WÃ¼rzburg. In 1180 Abbess Bertha (IV) appeared before King Friedrich to emplore his protection of the convent. King Heinrich granted the convent his protection.";FAUX

The convent lay within the parish of Westheim (Link, 607). The convent was established in 1236/7 by Abbess Jutta as a daughterhouse ofÂ Heiligenthal. Bishop Hermann of WÃ¼rzburg confrimed the foundation in January 1237 and recognized the nuns' right to freely elect their abbess as well as their freedom from a provost, although the bishop retained jurisdictional rights over the convent's goods (Krausen, 72-3). At the time of its foundation, the bishop sold the convent half of the village of Marburghausen, exempted the convent from tolls and divided the convent from the mother-church of Knetzgau.

Abbess Barbara Goldschelck refused to remit the tax. In order to collect on the tax, the count confiscated one of the convent's horses. The abbess then learned that the steward had secretly been paying the count the tax himself to avoid any difficulties. Abbess Goldschelk wrote to her colleague, Magdalena von Oettingen, abbess ofÂ Kirchheim, who in turn wrote to the count and reprimanded him. Abbess Magdalena correctly predicted that the count would fall from his horse as punishment by Saint Brigit. After the count did indeed fall and break his leg, he ordered that the horse be given back to the nuns and never again taxed the community.

It is likely that the convent was never formally incorporated into the Cisterican order, but lived according to the Benedictine rule and observed the institutions of Citeaux. A document of 1496 mentions the convent as containing Benedictine nuns, although it is unclear whether the convent had altered its observances by this time or not (Krausen, 60). The lords of Wildberg may also have been involved in the foundation of the community. A document dating to 1298, the earliest documentary mention of the convent, granted the lords of Wildberg the right to burial within the cloister.

Founded: Around 1260-1270 (sources vary slightly). This places its establishment during the first major wave of Dominican foundations for women in German-speaking lands.
Dominican Order (Second Order): Dominican nuns belong to the Second Order of Preachers, founded by St. Dominic himself to support the preaching mission of the friars (First Order) through prayer and contemplation.
Lauingen: An important town in Swabia (now Bavaria) on the Danube River. The presence of a Dominican nunnery indicates a strong religious sentiment and likely support from local nobility and wealthy burghers.
Relationship with Dominican Friars: The nuns would have been under the spiritual guidance of the Dominican friars, who would provide chaplains for Mass, confession, preaching, and theological instruction. There was a Dominican friary in nearby Augsburg.
Life of the Dominican Nuns:

Contemplative Prayer: This was the core of their existence, aimed at supporting the Dominican mission of ""preaching and the salvation of souls.""
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanted in choir at set times throughout the day and night. Dominican liturgy had its own specific rites.
Daily Mass.
Mental Prayer and Meditation: Significant time was dedicated to personal prayer and reflection on sacred texts.
Devotion to Study (unique to Dominicans): While primarily contemplative, the Dominican charism includes a strong emphasis on study and truth (Veritas). Nuns would have engaged in spiritual reading (Scriptures, Church Fathers, Dominican spiritual writers like Meister Eckhart, Tauler, Suso, who were influential in German Dominican convents, especially in the 14th century). This fostered a rich intellectual and mystical life.
Strict Poverty: Dominican nuns, like the friars, initially embraced a radical poverty, relying on alms. Over time, some communities, with permission, were allowed to hold property for their sustenance.
Enclosure (Cloister): They lived a strictly enclosed life within the monastery walls, fostering an atmosphere of prayer and separation from worldly distractions.
Community Life: Living together under a Prioress, sharing all things in common. The democratic spirit of the Dominican Order (e.g., in electing superiors) might have influenced community governance to some extent.
Manual Labor: This was part of their life, though perhaps less emphasized than in some Benedictine or Cistercian communities, as prayer and study held a primary place. Labor would include:
Spinning and Weaving: Producing textiles for their habits and other needs.
Needlework and Embroidery: Creating and mending clothing, altar linens. German Dominican convents were sometimes known for producing fine liturgical textiles and tapestries (e.g., ""Nonnenteppiche"" – nuns' tapestries).
Manuscript Work: Copying and illuminating manuscripts was a significant activity in many Dominican nunneries, contributing to their libraries and producing devotional books.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden.
Baking.
Language: Liturgical Latin for prayers and Mass; German (Swabian dialect) for everyday communication and for reading vernacular mystical texts.
Significance and Mysticism:

German Mysticism (Frauenmystik): Many Dominican nunneries in 14th-century Germany became centers of a vibrant female mystical movement. Nuns like those at St. Agnes in Lauingen could have been part of this tradition, characterized by intense personal religious experiences, visionary accounts, and devotional writings in the vernacular.
Education (Limited): While not formal schools in the modern sense, nunneries often provided an education for their members and sometimes for young girls from noble or burgher families who boarded with them before the enclosure became extremely strict.
Challenges and Endurance:

Medieval Crises: They faced plagues, famines, and wars common to the era.
The Reformation: Lauingen and the surrounding region experienced the religious upheavals of the Reformation. Whether St. Agnes survived this period or was temporarily suppressed and later restored would depend on the specific religious policies enacted in Lauingen. Many Dominican nunneries in areas that became Protestant were dissolved. However, if Lauingen remained predominantly Catholic or came under strong Catholic protection, the monastery might have persisted. Records indicate it did survive the Reformation.
Later History and Dissolution:

The monastery continued for centuries.
It was finally dissolved in 1802/1803 during the widespread Secularization in Bavaria, ending its long history. The buildings were repurposed.
In summary, the Dominican nuns of St. Agnes in medieval Lauingen lived a life dedicated to contemplative prayer, study, and community, supporting the Dominican order's mission. They were part of a significant network of Dominican nunneries in Germany, which were notable for their rich spiritual life, sometimes including mystical traditions, and their contributions to religious art and manuscript production. Their monastery endured for over five centuries until the Napoleonic-era secularizations.";FAUX

In 1013 Heinrich II took the convent into his protection. In 1128 Provost Gerhard of Riechenberg was commissioned to restore discipline within the convent (Hoogeweg, 56-57). According to KrÃ¤mer, the community existed as a house of canonesses from 1013-1126; from 1126 until its dissolution in 1810 the community was a house of Augustinian canonesses. ; In the middle of the fifteenth century, Prior Berthold brought the convent into the Windesheimer Reform and restored the impoverished convent to prosperity (Hoogeweg, 57). The canonesses initially fought the imposition of the Lutheran reform in the sixteenth century. They refused to give any food to the Protestant preachers sent to the convent, hiding whatever they had. None of the canonesses gave in to ducal pressure to leave, despite the promise of a twenty-gulden dowry (Wiesner-Hanks, 16). The convent converted to Lutheranism for a time until it was restored to Hildesheim through a ""Restoration Edict.""

The chapel received income from two houses and a hospital in Goslar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 262). The convent also possessed the house and farm of Provost Volkmar, four hides in Jerstedt (north-west of Goslar) and approximately eight hides of woodland in Ohlhof and half of the forest of Scherde. In 1186 a second altar was endowed with thirty stalls in the market of Goslar, which were rented out for 7 Marks yearly, in addition to eight hides (a hide =120 acres) in Ohlendorf and five and a half hides in Watenstedt (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 262). The letter of protection from Emperor Friedrich II on August 28, 1188 also mentions houses in a portion of Goslar known as RÃ¶merdorf, a house in the market, seven hides in StÃ¶ckhim (near WolfenbÃ¼ttel), four hides in Meimerdingerode (near Ohlendorf), in addition to property in Goslar with income from field and forest. The document also mentions a half of a mine in the silverworks in Rammelsberg (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 263). A document of Pope Innocent III from October 20, 1199 confirming the holdings of the convent mentions three portions of the forest in Axenberg with the neighboring smelting works, half of the forest in Camberg, and three mines in Rammelsberg. It also mentions three shares in the cobblers' shops and a house above the workshops. In addition, the convent owned seven hides in Alvesheim. In the thirteenth century, the convent expanded its land-holding, particularly through important acquisitions from 1208 to 1214 from the Benedictine monestary of S. Godehard in Hildesheim, in Alvese, Langelsheim and Bodenstein (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 253). In 1293 the convent was forced to hand over two of its mills to the city. The convent held property around Goslar (i.e. in Ohlhof, Jerstedt and Alvesheim) since its foundation in 1186/1199, but its holdings between Liebenburg and Vienenburg developed more slowly. During the twelfth century, the convent slowly acquired acres in these areas. By 1355 the convent held 12 hides in Ohlhof, seven hides in Jerstedt, five and a half in Langelsheim, 16 hides in Alvesheim, and seven hides in Weddingen. It also acquired holdings in DÃ¶rnten (approximately 20 hides) and in Immenrode (20 hides by 1390) (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 264). The convent's holdings in Innerstetal were continually developed in the thirteenth century, above all through the transfer of the rights of the dukes of Wohldenberg over their vassals (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 265). In Klein Sehlde the convent held 2 hides in 1256/58 and three in 1290; it had three hides in SÃ¶rde in 1259; in Baddeckenstedt it had three hides, three hides in Gronstede bei Steinlah and five hides in GroÃŸ Heer in 1302 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 265). By 1355 the convent held 14 hides in GroÃŸ Sehlde, 14 hides in Klein Sehlde, 5 in SÃ¶rde, 9 in Baddekenstedt, and 4 hides each in Klein Elbe and GroÃŸ Heere. The convent also had substantial hodlings in the dukedom of Brunschweig; eight hides in Ohlendorf, seven in FlachstÃ¶ckheim, five and a half in Watenstedt and four in Meimerdingerode (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 265). In the fourteenth century the convent acquired more holdings in this area: 6 hides in GroÃŸ Mahner by 1302, 10 hides in GroÃŸ FlÃ¶theby 1309, and four hides in Lobmachtersen by 1317. To the east, the convent held six hides in Gielde, seven in Werlaburgdorf. The convent also held two hides in Achim in 1355 and nine hides in Ziesel in 1266. In the fourteenth century, the convnet preserved and expanded its holdings through purchase and exchange; it seldom sold property. In 1355 the convent held in total 235 hides of land (roughly 28,200 acres). In the fifteenth century the convent's economic growth halted and in the sixteenth century it experienced economic reverses (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 263). During these centuries, the convent's land acquisition halted completely. In the sixteenth century particularly the convent suffered from making forced loans to the duke of Braunschweig-WolfenbÃ¼ttel. ; Provost Johannes (1217-1251) and Bishop Konrad II of Hildesheim (1221-1246) developed the convent's economy the most. By the end of the twelfth century, the convent was so rich that it was able to build the Romanesque church still visible today. The fourteenth century was the richest period in the convent's history. (See also Contributors' Notes) ; In 1245 Bishop Konrad II of Hildesheim decreed that those who helped the convent build a water-system (plumbing) would share in the 'good works' of the convent. In 1274 and 1275 the city of Goslar was granted the right to tax the church's property. In 1304 the convent made a contribution for the support of the Holy Land. In 1366 it contributed 10 Marks silver to the diocese of Hildesheim. At this time the convent was still well-off, due to the numerous bequests for Masses and memorials from the local bourgeousie.";"15381 ; Novum opus, Mariengarten, Ecclesia ad honorem sancte dei genetricis (1186); Hortus sancte Marie Goslarie (1208, 1210); Conventus sancte dei genetricis Marie in Goslaria (1214); Novum opus in Goslaria (1251); Nyenwerke (1338); Nienwerke (1521); S. Maria ; Founded in 1186, Neuwerk or S. Maria, was the first foundation for women in Goslar. The community was founded by the imperial governor, Volkmar von Wildenstein, and his wife Helena in the last years of the reign of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa. From 1173 to 1191 Volkmar served as the advocate for the city of Goslar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 250). The foundation began as an ""oratorium"" and RÃ¶mer-Johannsen credits Helena with the principal role in the creation of this community (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 251). On October 16, 1186 the first altar to the Virgin was consecrated by the bishop of Hildesheim, Adelog. On August 28, 1188 Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa confirmed the foundation of the ""oratorium"" and placed it under his protection, mentioning the convent for the first time as well (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252). Until the middle of the fourteenth century the convent vacillated between Benedictine and Cistercian observances (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252). Documents of Pope Innocent III, Pope Celestine V, and the eight foreign Bishops from 1339 refer to the community as Benedictine. On the other hand, documents from Pope Honorius III, the papal legate Konrad von Porto, Bishop Konrad II of Hildesheim and pope Alexander IV and Bonface VIII refer to the convent as Cistercian (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252). It appears that the papal legate Konrad von Porto influenced the adoption of Cistercian observances, but the convent did not belong directly to the Cistercian order. The convent's artwork emphasizes a Benedictine influence (see Art/Architecture). After Volkmar's death in 1191, his heirs made claims on Neuwerk and Abbess Antonia had to alienate a large portion of land in Winnigstedt to the Cistercian convent of Walkenried in order to satisfy the heirs (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252-3). ; In 1212 the provost of Neuwerk, Heinrich Minnike, a Premonstratensian monk, was accussed of heresy. He was accused together with the nuns of having thrown out the Benedictine rule, allowed the eating of meat and the wearing of linen dresses, and of having led the abbess to heresy. On March 12, 1223 the convent was reprimanded for its connection to the provost. Provost Minnike was excommunicated in October of 1224 and transferred to the secular courts, after having been tried in the ecclesiastical courts. During this turmoil, the city of Goslar tried to obtain the position of provost over Neuwerk for itself (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 254). Bishop Konrad II of Hildesheim supported the convent versus this. The convent opposed the Protestant reformation and came into conflict with the city once again over its possessions. On April 24, 1529 Duke Heinrich the Younger established an imperial mandate forbidding destruction of the church and its artworks, which protected the convent church in comparison to the destruction of the parish church (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 258). ; During the restoration of the younger pieta (mid-fifteenth century), restorers found a bundle of relics including a finger-bone and a bunch of hair from S. Andreas. A strip of pergament indicated that the relics came from S. Andreas and gave the year 1476 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 273). Another crucifix revealed relics from S. Nicholas and Stephen. ; Most of the documents from the convent of Neuwerk reside in the Stadtarchiv Goslar.

In addition to its landholding, Neuwerk acquired 18 tithes between 1210 and 1375, 17 in the diocese of Hildesheim and one in the diocese of Halberstadt (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 266). Three of these tithes were only held for a short term. At the time of dissolution, the convent held eight tithes: in Jerze since 1238, in Baddeckenstedt since 1241, in Gronstede since 1245, in Immenrode since 1246, a half of a tithe ion Burgdorf since 1268/69, another half in Achim since 1271, in DÃ¶rnten since 1278, and in Klein Sehlde since 1299 or 1353 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 266). Most of the convent's tithes were acquired between 1236 and 1246. In 1214 the convent acquired the tithe in Ambergau from the Benedictine convent of S. Godehard in Hildesheim. The convent acquired a tithe in Meimerdingerode in 1225 from Bishop Konrad II; in 1236 it acquired another in Gielde from the counts of Schladen and the nobles of Biewende, in 1237 it purchased a tithe in Klein Schladen from the vassals of Lengede and in 1256 it purchased another from the convent on the S. Johannes-Spital in Goslar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 267). In 1268/69 the convent received portions of tithes in Werlaburgdorf from the lord of Burgdorf and his vassals. ; Benedictine ; The convent celebrated many memorials for the bourgeousie of Goslar. In 1296 the priest Heinrich von Kalden established a memorial for himself; Bishop Siegfrid of Hildesheim did the same in 1304 and Duke Heinrich Mirabilis von Braunscehweig-LÃ¼neburg-GrÃ¼benhagen as well in 1312 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 256). It appears that the convent was composed of women from the nobility; in 1521 the first member from the bourgeousie is mentioned (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 268). The names of the abbesses come from the nobles in the areas surrounding Goslar. Between 1319 and 1360 forty-four family names can be established for the nuns: 6 are noble, but not necessarily with a connection to the city of Goslar; 24 come from ministerial families; 10 come from the old bourgeouis families, and 4 names can not be closely identified (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 268). It appears then that women from the bourgeousie could enter the convent. All novices required a dowry. ; The foundation was established with twelve nuns and the Abbess Anotonia from the convent of Ichtershausen. It is likely that the number of nuns in the community increased as the house became more wealthy. In 1377 the plague caused the death of many nuns; records refer to nine deaths in one day (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 268). ; In the imperial city of Goslar; in the bishopric of Hildeshem. ; In 1475 the convent received a visitation from Bishop Henning of Hildesheim and the abbesses of the Auguustinian house of Dernburg and the Cistercian convent ofÂ WÃ¶ltingerode. In the visitation report the convent was criticized for its linen clothing, private property kept in trunks, the lax observance of confession, for not observing the rules of silence in the church, dormitory, refectory, and chapter-hall. In addition, the nuns were accused of having taken part in the festivities in the city, of having danced and sung and worn red shoes! (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 257). Although nuns fromÂ WÃ¶ltingerodeÂ were to be sent to the community to help reform it, this never happened. Instead, Bishop Henning revised the community's organization and established an 'advisory board,' which would support the abbess in administrating the community (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 257). ; On January 1, 1186 Bishop Adelog consecrated an altar to Mary in the Oratorium erected by the founding couple. In August of the same year he consecrated a second to Mary, the holy cross and S. John as well as others, whose relics resided there. At this time the church had been begun and was continuing to be expanded. By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the main apse and west side was completed. In 1220-30 the church was painted and in 1362 the ceiling was painted (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 272). The west facade of the church has two towers, and the second-story halls correspond to the style of Cistercian buildings. Like all the churches in Goslar, Neuwerk follows the model of the imperial cathedral of S. Simon and S. Juda. The main portal on the north side of the church contains a tympanum with the Madonna seated on a throne with child, surrounded on her left and right by praying saints; this was presumably carved circa 1240 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 272). On the south wall of the choir is an important relief of the farewell between Jesus and Maria on Maundy Thursday. The church contains certain elements in its architecture which are unique to this structure, particularly in its pillars. The two western pillars have the faces of demons at their top. Graves were also located in the church through archaeological digs. The founders tombs resided in the church. The conventual buildings from the Middle Ages no longer exist, but are apparent through archaeological surveys. A garden between the church and the baroque cloister buildings reveal traces of an older building from before 1100. In 1355 an inventory mentions a mill, bakehouse, washhouse, pigsty, provost's lodgings, a kitchen, and wagon outbuilding, as well as the church (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 274). ; The High Altar was consecrated to S. Benedict and his sister Scholastica, and the nuns' choir was painted with Benedictine saints in the thirteenth century. This would appear to indicated an identification with the Benedictine order (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252). On the south side of the church in its interior is a stone slab with a carved angel, holding in its hand the words ""Miri facta vide Laudando viri lapicide"" (Behold in praise the [artwork] made by the remarkable stonecutter), while the name ""Wilhelmi"" is carved on the corbel. The work likley refers to the stonecutter, William, perhaps the same Wilhelm mentioned in a document from 1255 (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 273). The church still retains artwork from the Middle Ages, including a pieta of wood from the mid-fifteenth century, and a statue of Mary lamenting, which once held relics. The painting in the main choir, which depicts the Virgin Mother on the throne of wisdom from circa 1230/40 is unique in Lower Saxony. The mural reflects Byzantine influences (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 273). Other liturgical items from the convent were sold or alienated in the sixteenth century. Church items and tower clocks were later purchased and restored in 1841. The abbesses seal used from 1373-1575 depicts a praying Christ beneath a rainbow, with a book in his left hand. The abbess is also depicted kneeling in prayer (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 279). The convent's seal depicted a throned Madonna with the Christ child in her left arm and a scepter of lillies in her right hand (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 280). The provost's seal was similar to the convent's seal. ; In the thirteenth century, in addition to the abbess, the offices of prioress, celleeraria, custodian, cameraria, and magistra infirmarum are mentioned. As in many other convents, the provost was responsible for secular and religious duties for the convent. Neuwerk also had chaplians. Beginning in 1188, the convent had the right to freely elect its provosts. However, the bishop and later the city of Goslar had an influence on the election (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 270). Above all the provost was responsible for the economic and legal concerns of the convent: acquisitions and alienations, loans and exchanges, and legal matters. The provost, however, was required to obtain the convent's agreement to all such actions (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 270). References are also made to a ""farm-manager,"" most likely a lay person responsible for the running of the farms. In 1570, the duke of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg-WolfenbÃ¼ttel, Julius, ordered the nuns of Neuwerk to accept the Lutheran faith. The convent opposed this and retained the Cistercian habit until 1575. Julius, in turn, increasingly penalized the convent economically. He took away almost all of the convent's property outside of the city of Goslar, and the nuns had to support themselves through sewing and knitting (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 259). Around the turn of the sixteenth/seventeenth century certain nuns accepted Protestantism, and the convent split into two when the dissenting nuns established a new evangelical convent of Neuwerk under Dominae Lucia Lamprecht and Margarete Schmiedes. In 1631 the Swedes conquered the city of Goslar and dissolved the convent (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 259). In the course of the nineteenth century the convent lost its monastic character. In 1964 it became an evangelical church and in 1969 the convent was dissolved (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 262). ; The library of the convent remains unknown, although RÃ¶mer-Johannsen states that it certainly had a scriptorium (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 271). It is likely that the Goslar ""Evangeliar"" (circa 1340, 127 pages of pergament with minatures in a Byzantine style) belonged to the convent! ; When Emperor Barbarossa confirmed the foundation, he absolved it from the official taxes and duties as well as from the secular jurisdiction. He also confirmed the convent's right to the free election of its provosts (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 252). ; Ichtershausen, (the first Cistercian convent in northern Germany). When the nuns established their new community in Goslar, they gave relics of S. Godhard to their mother-house of Ichtershausen (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 251). However, a later connection between the two houses is not apparent. ; The first members and the first abbess of the community came from the earliest female Cistercian foundation in northern Germany, Ichtershausen. At the time of the foundation, Provost Wolfram of Ichtershausen oversaw Neuwerk as well. ; The Romanesque church built towards the end of the twelfth century still stands today. The church of Neuwerk is one of the few Romanesque churches in northern Germany that remains unchanged since its erection (from before 1200-the mid-thirteenth century). the convent church remains almost completely in tact with its important wall-paintings. The conventual buildings from the Middle Ages no longer exist, but are apparent through archaeological surveys. A garden between the church and the Baroque cloister buildings reveal traces of an older building from before 1100. ; In 1334 the parish church of S. Jacoi and in 1356 the parish in Klein FlÃ¶the were incorporated into the convent. On March 20, 1355 the Cistercian abbot Eggeling of Riddagshausen freed the convent from excommunication, which it had incurred in favoring the bishop of Hildesheim opposed by the pope (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 256). The Augustinian canons of S. Georgenberg celebrated masses in the convent's church until 1399 when the ties between the two communities were dissolved. Neuwerk held the patronage of the parish church S. Jacobus in Goslar; the bishop of Hildesheim transferred it to the convent in 1334. The church in Ziesel (Theseln) belonged to the convent since 1266, when Dukes Albrecht and Johann of Saxony-Wittenberg gave it to the community as a gift (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 271). In 1302 the convent acquired half of the right of patronage in GroÃŸ Mahner but traded this with the bishop of Hildesheim for rights of patronage in the church in GroÃŸ FlÃ¶the. ; The convent was caught in the contest between the Staufers and the Welfs over the possession of the city of Goslar and also came into conflict with the city itself, which attempted to influence the convent through its economics. On January 16, 1200 the convent received a document of protection from the Staufer King Phillip von Schwaben. However, in 1205 the Welfish army took over the city. In 1290 the last count of Wohldenberg transfered the right to protectorship over the convent to the city council of Goslar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 255). Throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the city of Goslar exerted more control over the convent. It took over two of its mills and placed male overseers in the convent, visible from 1304 on. The convent had little say in their appointment. The city council had influence over the economic state of the convent as well as the internal conventual life, such as the distribution of money to the nuns and the celebration of Masses and anniversaries. By the mid-fourteenth century, the convent stood under the total control of the city council of Goslar (RÃ¶mer-Johannsen, 255).

The economic basis of the priory was founded on the dowries of the nuns entering the community (Riggert). The community also had numerous landholdings and holdings in the LÃ¼neburg saltworks. Among all the convents in the principality of LÃ¼neburg, Ebstorf had the largest number of saltholdings. The community held land and tithes in Bardenhagen, Bornsen, Ebstorf, Golste, Luchtmissen, Oetzfelde, Oldendorf, Tatendorf, Walmstorf, Wittenwater, Addenstorf, Bahnsen, Cote, Eddelstorf, Graulingen, and property in Abbendorf and Grieben (Urkundenbuch). The convent's possessions in these areas probably came from the founder or his son, Heinrich (Jaitner, 176). Circa 1225 the convent came into disputes with Corvey and Kemnade over six houses in Bahnsen and three in Graulingen. At the time of foundation, the convent also acquired tithes and farm land. In 1262 the convent sold a village near Eddelstorf toÂ Medingen. In 1318 the convent received the posision of Estorp bei Vinstedt, which was probably the ancestral seat of the family from Estorff (Jaitner, 175). The convent's possessions were divided between the provost and the community's holdings, as in all Benedictine convents (Urkundenbuch). In 1368 the convent received a half of the village of Hanstedt from Huner von Oedeme (Jaitner, 169). On May 25, 1372 the nephews of Huner freed the provost from the accusation-the confirmation of Duke Magnus followed on July 2- and transferred all their possessions in Hanstedt and its surroundings to the convent for 950 Marks (Jaitner, 169). Circa 1568 the provost held the largest portion of the tithes and landholdings and approximately half of the salt possessions (Urkundenbuch). In 1293 the convent acquired the tithe from Lehmke, Bohlsen and Hansen from the families from the Berge and Schulenburg. In 1300 the convent made its single biggest investment in the acquisition of the ""villam totalem Melzingen"" from the family of Meltzing for 100 Marks silver, which was composed of 15 farms and the family seat in 1568 (Urkundenbuch). There followed in 1318, two farms in Estorp; in 1324 the purchase of Barnsen for 300 Marks; 1325 three farms in Hohenbuenstorf and circa 1337 several farms in Westerweyhe and Altenebstorf (Jaitner, 177). In 1318 the convent received farms in Wessenstedt and Kirchweyhe; in 1320/21 the tithes of Bargfeld and Breloh and in 1322/23 several farms in Lehmke. In 1320 the convent purchased the whole villa in Linden (approximately 10 farms in 1568)for 210 Marks. In 1321 it acquired possessions in Stadorf for 335 Marks and the mill in Wittenwater for 25 Marks. The tithes from Tatendorf and Teendord were acquired for 100 Marks from Herman Klueving in 1244; from Etzen for 130 Marks from the family of Dyse in 1319; and the tithes from Bargfeld for 180 Marks from the family from the heide in 1321 (Jaitner, 178). Between 1368-1372 the convent acquired property in Oedemeschen and around Hanstedt for 1850 Marks silver. On February 14, 1368 Huner von Oedeme sold to Duke Wilhelm six farms, a half a castle, and a half a mill as well as the jurisdiction and patronage rights in the parish church in Hanstedt as well as further farms in Teendorf, Bode, Brauel, Allenbostel, Eitzen, Holthusen and Betzendorf. The duke in turn gave these to the convent in June of 1368 (Jaitner, 178). This included forest holdings and all the rights in these areas (Urkundenbuch). The community was exempt from regulations on cutting wood in Suessing in Hanstedt, Melzinger and Barnser. After 1360 the convent acquired by purchase and donation holdings in the cities of LÃ¼neburg and Uelzen, primarily consisting of rents from houses (Urkunden). From 1430-1451 the convent acquired property in MÃ¼den. In 1568 the convent held landed possessions in 66 places (40 of which belonged to the provost) (Jaitner, 177). The convent also owned mills in several locations, inluding Ebstorf, Lehmke, Eimke, Wittenwater, Stortenbuettel, Hanstedt, Barum and Hoesseringen, and Molzen (Jaitner, 179). The convent also had charge of a winery near Wessenstedt, a number of pastures, a fishery and brick-works and tile-works production, which was sold to Celle (Jaitner, 179). The convent also had extensive forest holdings, the most important of which was in SÃ¼sing. ; The community was quite wealthy. The wealth of the community is illustrated by the report that following the reform of 1469, the new abbess confiscated such quantities of gold and silver jewelry that after fashioning a portion into reliquaries so much remained that it had to be stored in a coffer (Hamburger, 119). The financial foundation of the convent rested on landed possessions, tithes and patronage-rights as well as urban possessions in the salt-works, of houses, and of rents in LÃ¼neburg and Uelzen (Jaitner, 175). The period of growth in the possessions of the convent existed from 1300-1350. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the convent tried to secure and increase its economic basis. From 1293-1345 the convent was in the position to invest approximately 2440 Marks for tithes and 3060 Marks for possessions, and in 1367-1394 again approximately 180 Marks for tithes and 2850 for possessions (Jaitner, 176). After 1350 the convent experienced economic decline. ; The nuns in the principality of LÃ¼neburg were famous for their wool and silk embroidery and their textile production. It is unclear whether they received income from these productions. The convent also engaged in making loans to local families (Jaitner, 180). The convent also benefitted financially from the pilgrimages to the Ebstorf martyrs, which began during the fourteenth century (Jaitner, 187).";"13132 ; Ebbekestorpe; Ebbikesdorp (1197); Hebbicstorpe (1241); Ebbistorf; Ebstorppe; Ebstorff ; No foundation document remains; information about the convent's foundation comes from a history written circa 1478 by a nun of the community. According to this record, Count Volrad von Dannenberg (1158-1174), from the noble family of Bodwede, and his wife, Gerburg, founded the community for canons. (It is not known if the canons were Augustinian or Premonstratensian; although Jaitner thinks it likely that they were Premonstratensian due to the dedication to S. Mauritius). The foundation was confirmed by Bishop Hermann von Behr. Shortly after its foundation a fire burned the buildings and the canons left the location (Urkundenbuch). Heinrich, the son of Count Volrad, at the request of his sister and the reform-minded canonesses from the neighboring convent ofÂ Walsrode, took the place of the male canons (Riggert). It probably assumed the Benedictine rule from the beginning. The first documentary mention of the community is in 1197, when the provost from Ebstorf is named in the foundation document of the Old-convent of Buxtehude (Hoogeweg, 30). The convent is first mentioned in a tithe-list of the foundation charter of the Benedictine convent of Altkloster bei Buxtehude in 1197 (Riggert). Under provost Albrecht in the thirteenth century the convent experienced an economic and artistic peak (Jaitner, 167). ; The community experienced economic difficulties and a period of stagnation after the plague in 1350 and as a result of the LÃ¼neburg succession wars circa 1369. The community aligned itself with the side of the duke of Braunschweig and experienced economic losses (Riggert). In 1464 the convent underwent an internal reform, promoted by provost Matthias von dem Knesebeck and completed in 1476. The reform was associated with the Bursfeld congregation. At this time structural and architectural changes were undertaken. The goals of the reform were a renewal of strict observances, strict adherence to poverty and enclosure, the establishment of the mensa communis, increased educational standards for the nuns, and sanitation of the convent buildings(Urkundenbuch). The reform began in the middle of May with the removal of the disputed prioress Gertrud von der Molen and the election of Gertrudis von der Brake (Jaitner, 172). Knesebeck then entrusted the reform of the liturgy to the abbess of the Benedictine convent of Hadmersleben and two nuns from her convent (Jaitner, 172). The convent never became an official member of the Bursfeld congregation, however. After the reform, the convent experienced a period of renewal with the erection of new buildings, artistic embellishment of the church and chapels and the assembly of new texts for the liturgy. On March 3, 1496 Prioress Barbara von Hodenberg complained to the LÃ¼neburg council about the condition of the convent, both spiritually and in worldly things (Jaitner, 173). After this internal reform duke Ernst removed the provost and placed a ducal cloister-administrator in his place until the position was dissolved in 1528. In 1528 the income of the community was attached to the ducal domains (Hoogeweg, 30). The community came under the pressure of the Lutheran Reform in 1529 under Duke Ernst. The nuns greatly resisted the duke's efforts at reformation under the prioress Elisabeth von Dannenberg. Despite the visitation of Urban Rhegius and threats from the neighboring rulers, the convent resisted. It also wi ; The community became a pilgrimage site between 1290-1350; pilgrims came to worship the Ebstorf martyrs, who gained their martyrdom in a Norman battle circa 882, and were worshiped in a chapel located in the cemetary precinct. Ebstorf's position as a pilgrimage site gave the community a prominence which none of the other LÃ¼neburg convents possessed (Riggert). The convent still preserves a statue of the enthroned Madonna, which once served as a reliquary for the holy blood of the martyrs. ; The medieval documents still exist and are housed in the LÃ¼neburger KlÃ¶sterarchive. Ebstorf has one of the richest manuscript holdings, numbering approximately 426 documents from circa 1220-1741. Most of the extant manuscripts stem from the fifteenth century, including several homilies and theological tracts. A Latin grammer, Latin-Niederdeutsch vocabulary list and a musical tract were probably used in the conventual school (Jaitner, 186). The two illustrated manuscripts are Ms. VI, 2 and Ms. V, 3, which were held in the conventual library of Ebstorf. ; Die Luneburger Frauenkloster'In Treue und Hingabe': 800 Jahre Kloster EbstorfDie Bibliothek des Klosters Ebstorf am Ausgang des MittelaltersKloster Ebstorf.Art, Enclosure and the Cura Monialium: Prolegomena in the Guise of a PostscriptVerzeichnis der Stifter und KlÃ¶ster Niedersachsens vor der ReformationFigÃ¼rliche Buchmalereien in den spÃ¤tmittelalterlichen Handschriften der LÃ¼neburger FrauenklÃ¶ster.Studien und Texte zur Literarischen und Materiellen Kultur der FrauenklÃ¶ster im spÃ¤ten Mittelalter: Ergebnisse eines ArbeitsgesprÃ¤chs in der Herzog August Bibliothek WolfenbÃ¼ttel, 24-26 Februar 1999Evangelischer Klosteralltag: Leben in LÃ¼neburger Frauenkonventen, 1590-1710, untersucht am Beispiel EbstorfDas Projekt einer Neuausgabe der Ebstorfer WeltkarteDas mittelalterliche Vesperbild und der zwei noch vorhandenen Werke in Eimke und Kloster EbstorfEbstorf : aus der Geschichte des KlosterfleckensDrei Miniaturen aus den ehemaligen KlÃ¶stern LÃ¼ne und EbstorfDas Benediktinerinnenkloster Ebstorf im Mittelalter : VortrÃ¤ge einer Tagung im Kloster Ebstorf vom 22. bis 24.

The convent held an important portion of the LÃ¼neburg saltworks; these were acquired primarily through purchase in the fourteenth century (Urkundenbuch). After the male house of S. Michael, LÃ¼neburg, and the convent ofÂ LÃ¼ne, Ebstorf was the third largest holder of salt-pans (Urkundenbuch). The convent held a few salt-holdings in the thirteenth century (4 documents are extant); however, in the fourteenth century the convent acquired several more holdings (32 documents are extant from 1300-1355). The convent thus reached its economic highpoint in the first half of the fourteenth century. Another important source of income came from the convent's legal and jurisdictional authority in Ebstorf and Munster (Jaitner, 179). The community also received income from rents from houses and bonds of the city treasurer (Jaitner, 181). In LÃ¼neburg the convent recieved taxes from 17 houses in 1414, amounting to approximately 170 Marks (Jaitner, 181). The houses often came into the hands of the convent through the entrance dowries of the nuns or memorials. ; The convent had legal and jurisdictional authority (through its provost) in the ; Augustinian ; The nuns were drawn from the local nobility in the dukedom of LÃ¼neburg and the urban patriciate, primarily from the towns of LÃ¼neburg and Uelzen (Urkundenbuch). Through the dowries of these women, the convent acquired land and salt possessions. ; Population counts are unavaliable prior to the fifteenth century. In October of 1464 the community recorded forty-nine sisters and a prioress. Students and novices are also mentioned (Urkundenbuch). ; The convent lies in the western part of the district of Uelzen in the LÃ¼neburg Heide (heath). It is located approximately 25 kilometers from the town of LÃ¼neburg, not far from the city of Uelzen on an important North-South route. ; The community was located in the dukedom of Saxony circa 961 and then came under the dukedom of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg . ; The provosts held spiritual jurisdiction over the community and the right of visitation. In 1469/70 Johannes Busch visited the community while Knesebeck was in the process of reforming the convent (Jaitner, 172). In 1496 there was a visitation by the bishop of Verden and administrator from Hildesheim, Bertold von Landsberg, together with the abbot of Oldenstadt and the provosts ofÂ LÃ¼neÂ andÂ MedingenÂ and the observant Franciscan, Heinrich Anckem (Jaitner, 173). The result was the confirmation of Knesebeck's reform and the establishment of a division between the holdings of the provost and the convent. ; The community flourished from 1290-1350 under provost Albrecht. Circa 1280-1290 (perhaps as late as 1350) the community's gothic-style buildings were completed (the convent buildings were built partly from Romanesque remains). The western portion of the church with the Nuns' choir and the eastern portion with the High choir were roofed circa 1384/5-1396 (Jaitner, 186). At the time of internal reform (circa 1450-1467) structural and architectural changes were undertaken under Provost Knesebeck. In 1469/70 he built a new church;in 1471 the refectory was refurbished.Â Ebstorf, church and bell towerÂ In 1485-87 a high wall was erected around the garden, in order to enforce strict enclosure (Jaitner, 186).Â Ebstorf Reform WallÂ At this time the garden buildings, the cloister and the chapels in the cemetery were restored as well as the ducal house. The church was built in the Gothic Brick-style.Â Ebstorf church (detail)Â The church and chapel were lavishly decorated. In 1296 there is mention of an altar dedicated to S. Mary. The parish church had no contact with the nuns in the Nuns' choir. A bell-tower on the south-west corner of the church stems from the fifteenth century (Jaitner, 186).Â Ebstorf Bell TowerÂ The convent has a north-oriented cloister. The south-wing of the convent lies underneath the Nun's choir within the church structure and takes one-third of the space. On the north side of the High choir a side chapel is located, which was consecrated to S. Bartholomew; on the eastern side there is another chapel and the sacristry. In 1474 Provost Knesebeck permitted a new arrangement of the Nuns' choir, in which he placed a wooden gate, through which the communion could be passed to the nuns and the reliquaries could be viewed (Jaitner, 187). Around the cloister were grouped the convent buildings: on the east stood the entrance, chapter hall, and pilgrim-lodgingsÂ Ebstorf, east wing. The provost's house was attached to the western wing.Â Ebstorf Provost's HouseÂ In the north wing were the refectory and the sleeping quaters; on the east side lay the prioress and abbesses' wing. To the north of the cloister were the economic buildings, such as the kitchen, brewery, and house for the curia.Â Ebstorf breweryÂ Ebstorf Brewery (side)Â In the cemetary precinct to the sourth and east of the convent church lay the chapel dedicated to the Ebstorf martyrs; in 1439 a new chapel was erected next to this one and dedicated to S. Anna. The chapels were presumably destroyed in the period of the Reformation (Jaitner, 187). Later many buildings were rebuilt in the baroque style (Riggert). ; The convent of Ebstorf preserves many of the medieval artworks and tapestries. Circa 1420 the fifteen stained glass windows in the west-wing of the convent, depicting the ""mirror of human salvation"" (Heilsspiegel), were created. These glass windows are still extant.Â Ebstorf, Arisen ChristEbstorf, Christ Prepared for BurialÂ The stained glass windows in the Nuns' choir date from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. They were partially financed by the city council of LÃ¼neburg. Several trunks from the period of the convent's foundation still exist. There is also a ""triumphal cross"" which dates to circa 1230 and resides in the Landesgalerie in Hannover. Most of the remaining artifacts date from the high point of the convent between 1290 and 1350. The choir stools date to circa 1290; a wooden statue of S. Mauritius dates from the end of the thirteenth century. There is a bronze baptismal by Master Hermanus from 1310 as well as important tapestries, including an altar cloth from the first half of the fourteenth century (Jaitner, 187). A statue of the enthroned Madonna with child from the period of the pilgrimages to Ebstorf (circa 1290-1350) still exists in the nuns' choir. It once served as a shrine or reliquary for the holy blood of the martyrs. The convent also preserves wooden chests from circa 1177. Statues of the patron of the cloister, S. Mauritius, ChristÂ Ebstorf, Arisen Christ, and the apostles still exist as well. The convent preserves embroideries and liturgical items in a small museum. The convent seal, which remained in use unaltered until the Reformation, was created in the twelfth century. It depicts S. Mauritius with a halo in armour with his left arm on a shield and a lance with a pennant in his right arm (Jaitner, 192). The provost's seal changed over time, but always depicted S. Mauritius. The only extant seal of the prioress is the seal of Elisabeth von Dannenberg, which depicts a large profile of a saint (either S. Anna or Elizabeth) with a smaller praying nun with a veil (Jaitner, 192). The illustrations in the two illustrated manuscripts still extant show that the nuns drew iconographically from works produced in the other convents of the region and from other older models, such as French and English works of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Uhde-Stahl, 27). Both manuscripts date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. One contains several images of the Virgin Mary and the life of Christ; the other manuscript (Ms. V,3) is an instructional manual for music education. This manuscript contains images for teaching the muscial scale and tones (ut, re, mi, fa, so, etc.)Â Ebstorf, Guidonian handÂ and depicts Benedictine nuns playing instruments and instructing children in the muscial artsÂ Ebstorf, Hortus Conclusus. The familiarity with which musical instruction in a convent and the nuns are portrayed indicate that this manuscript was produced by a female member of the convent. Other manuscripts from Ebstorf contain hymns and a Latin grammar, presumably also used in teaching (Uhde-Stahl, 28-29). ; The Ebstorf Weltkarte [map of the world] is quite famous; it was produced during Johannes Propst's time as provost (1256-1281) and was presumably conceived by the cleric, diplomat, and writer, Gervasius von Tilbury. The original was destroyed by bombing during World War II, but it has been reconstructed on the basis of a copy of the original. ; The Ebstorf Weltkarte was produced during Johannes Propst's time as provost (1256-1281) either at or for the convent. The convent used to have a very rich library. However, the first act of the reforming prioress, Gertrude von dem Brake, was to confiscate all existing choir books, declare them corrupt, and have them cut to shreds. Thus none of Ebstorf's choir books survive (Hamburger, 121). The nuns appear to have been active in copying and illustrating manuscripts, but only two illustrated manuscripts managed to survive (see manuscript sources). ; Count Volrad von Dannenberg and his wife Gerburg. Count Heinrich von Dannenberg and his sister. The counts of Danneberg assumed the protectorship/advocacy over the convent until 1303. Since 1303, as vassals of the counts of Dannenberg, the dukes of LÃ¼neburg possessed the advocacy over the convent (Urkundenbuch). The dukes generally worked to strengthen the privileges of the convent, and since the fourteenth century, they had a direct influence over the development of the convent through the presentation of the provost (Urkundenbuch). Families which sold or bequeathed their possessions to the convent included the families of: Meltzing, Boldensele, Bodendike, Estorff, Schack, Grotes, Dyse, Heide, Bispingen, Berge, and Oedeme. ; Nuns from the neighboring convent ofÂ WalsrodeÂ under the prioress Hassica? (Jaitner, 166). The first documented prioress was Mechtild (listed in 1255 in a convent document); tradition records the first prioress as Hassica. In order the prioresses were: (Hassica); Mechtild (1255, 1307); Elisabeth (1317, 1328); Margarethe (1330); Adelheid (1331, 1338); Jutta Provest (1342, 1342); Adelheid (1344); Jutta Provest (1346, 1366); Elisabeth (1368, 1377); Bertha von Boldensele (1383); Irmgard (1390, 1393); Hildeburgis (1397, 1406); Anna Provest (1408, 1426); Mechthild (1429, 1432); Margarethe von Wenden (1434, 1440 resigned); Gertrud von der Molen (1451-1469 resigned); Gertrud von dem Brake (1469); Mechthild von Niendorf (1470-1495); Barbara von Hodenberg (1495-1510). ; The convent and many of the medieval artworks from it still exist. (See Art and Architecture). Several of the buildings were remodeled in the baroque style. ; Until 1303 the counts of Dannenberg from the founding family of Bodwede held the right of protectorship over the convent. The descendants of Count Volrad held the protectorship over the convent for 150 years; it then came into the hands of the dukes of LÃ¼neburg (Jaitner, 181). The dukes repeatedly confirmed the privileges of the convent. The convent had close relations with the local ruling families. From 1290 on the convent grew close to the Welf ruling house and was increasingly influenced by this connection (Riggert). Circa 1303 the Welfs acquired the right of protectorship over the convent (Jaitner, 167). The Welfs held the right of presentation of the provost. In 1322 the duke freed the convent from tolls and garanteed all previous privileges (Jaitner, 168). The relationship with the local nobility was expressed in 1330 in the extension of spiritual confraternity to the deceased Otto II and his wife Mathilde, his son Otto III and his wife Mathilda (Jaitner, 168). From the time of Heinrich von Offensen (1365-1393) to the Lutheran Reformation there was a practically unbroken line of ducal notararies and chancellors who occupied the position of provost in Ebstorf (Riggert). ; The reform of 1469/70 was influenced by the Benedictine convent of Huysburg and the Bursfeld Congregation.";FAUX

The convent also acquired 13 hides (hide = 120 acres) and interests in the salt works in LÃ¼neburg from the bourgeousie of Bardowikc, the cathedral chapter in Hamburg and noble gifts. Most of the convent's acquisitions of land came from the nobility, while its interests in the salt works stemmed from grants of urban residents (Reinhardt, 386). However, gifts accounted for less of the convent's holdings than purchases. It also acquired the land surrounding the chapel to S. Jacob, probably as a gift from the convent of S. Michaelis (Reinhardt, 378). In the first half of the thirteenth century the convent received property in both Dalldorf and Kalstorf as well as a little income from the salt works. No provost did more to improve the financial position of the convent than Johannes Weigergang. Between 1382 and 1405 he acquired 42 farms, five fields, wood- and fishing-rights, and income from the salt works (Reinhardt, 380). In return he sold only 10 of the convent's farms and a few small tithes and rents in the salt works. He ensured further financial stability for the community by influencing the election of his successor, his nephew Heinrich von Bodenstedt, elected by the nuns in 1412 (Reinhardt, 381). In 1369/70 the convent's salt holdings encompassed 12 salt pans, 51 sections (Chor), 2 Plaustra and 2 rents. The convent was the second largest holder of salt possessions after the (male) convent of S. Michaelis in LÃ¼neburg (Reinhardt, 386). In addition to its salt holdings, the convent also owned land within the city of LÃ¼neburg. The convent acquired its first house within the city in 1271. By 1531 the convent owned six buildings within the city. Since 1391 the convent also possessed a mill in the city. The land-holdings of the convent were primarily concentrated between Ilmenau and Neetze. ; In the twelfth and early thirteenth century the convent's income was rather modest. The community's land holdings increased through personal bequests. As well as rebuilding of the convent in 1372, provost Weigergang secured the financial position of the community and acquired further privileges for the convent. By 1440 under the able leadership of provosts Johannnes Weigergang, Heinrich von Bodenstedt, and Cord van Tzerstede, the convent had achieved a level of prosperity and stability, which it would never reach again (Reinhardt, 381). ; The convent engaged in baking and brewing, which may date back to its medieval period, although definite confirmation is lacking. Reinhardt also surmises that the convent had a weaving-workshop within the cloister, although it is uncertain whether the nuns produced their tapestries for economic reasons (Reinhardt, 396). ; Circa 1389 the church in Betzendorf was incorporated into LÃ¼ne; from 1272-1536 the church in Rade was also incorporated into the convent. The chapel of S. Gangulfi was incorporated in the community from 1480-1531. The church in Adendorf was partially under the patronage of the convent from the thirteenth century. The church in Handorf was under the convent's patronage since 1282, as was the church in Thomasburg from 1361-1609. The church in Reinstrof was under the convent's patronage from 1361-1609 (Reinhardt, 392). In 1370 the provost, prioress, and convent of LÃ¼ne acquired the right of patronage over the vicary of S. Barbara in LÃ¼neburg, and since 1412 the prioress held the right to nominate the priests for the vicarage of S. Elisabeth in the S. John Church in LÃ¼neburg.";"18041 ; Hliuni (795); Luine (1140); Rodestorpe sive Lune (1261) ; The Benedictine convent was located on a site inhabited since circa by a monk of the community of S. Michaelis in LÃ¼neburg. After the hermit/monk left, a chapel dedicated to Jacob was erected on the site. The site was situated on an important street linking the commercial towns of LÃ¼beck and Frankfurt (Reinhardt, 377). LÃ¼ne was a noble foundation, but the convent of S. Michaelis also had a decisive role in its foundation. There is no extant foundation document. A confirmation charter by the bishop of January 9, 1172 refers to an earlier charter of protection bestowed by S. Bartholomaeus (Bartholomew). According to convent tradition, in 1171 Berthold, abbot of S. Michaelis, allowed religious women to establish a community by the Jacob-chapel in LÃ¼ne, which belonged to S. Michaelis (Riggert). The women were under the leadership of Hildewidis von Marcboldestorp. Hildeswidis probably belonged to a ministerial family of the Welfs from Marmstorf (Reinhardt, 377). The exact location of the chapel is unknown. It is unclear where the women who formed the convent in 1171 came from; Riggert and Reinhardt both speculate that they may have come from Nordborstold, later Heiligenrode, near Hamburg-Harburg, where members of Hildewidis' family had land holdings (Riggert; Reinhardt, 377-8). Indeed, it is probable that Hildewidis attempted to found the convent on a portion of her inherited property, meeting with the disapproval of her neighbors and being forced to relocate (Reinhardt, 378). Approval of the foundation was given by Duke Henry the Lion and Bishop Hugo of Verden on January 9, 1172. (Hoogeweg thus states that the convent was founded in 1172.) It is likely that the convent first consisted of a group of canonesses rather than Benedictine nuns. The mention of ten inhabitants in 1231 corresponds to this theory. The convent was destroyed by fire twice, in 1240 and on April 30, 1372. It appears that after the fire of 1240 the community became a regular Benedictine convent (Reinhardt, 378). The documents record that three women died in the fires, the nuns Margarete Gevs and Margarete Ditmers, and a ""puella scolaris,"" who was the daughter of the LÃ¼neburger Burgermeister Hartwig Abbenborch. The period between the two fires was a time of internal and external consolidation for the convent. The nuns lived according to the rule of S. Benedict, but little information exists as to their religious practices. No statutes from the community are extant. According to Reinhardt, it appears that the community did not follow the strictest of Benedictine observance. The nuns were permitted to retain private property and inherit freely (Reinhardt, 379). After the fire of 1372 the convent moved to its present location closer to the Ilmenau and the city of LÃ¼neburg (Riggert;Reinhardt, 380). ; Other patron saints of the convent were Jacob, the Trinity, the Holy Cross, Michael, Benedict, Christopher, and Maternianus. The community flourished under the provosts Johannes Weigergang (1374-1412), Heinrich von Bodenstedt (1412-1433) and Cord von Tzerstede (1433-1440), through whom the convent's holdings were increased and stabilized. In the fifteenth century the community experienced decline, partially due to the provost Dietrich Schaper (1140-1451), who sided with the leader of the opposition versus the city in the LÃ¼neburg Prelate-war (Riggert). In 1451 an attempt was made to depose Schaper as the provost of LÃ¼ne; the prioress Susanne Munter wrote in support of Schaper (Reinhardt, 382). Nevertheless, Schaper was deposed in 1451 and excommunicated. Nikolaus Graurock followed Schaper as provost of the community. Under Prioress Mechtild Wilde the previous internal reform of the convent reached its highpoint circa 1504 in a late flowering of monastic thought and life (Reinhardt, 383). Communal meals and seven hours of choir service were reestablished and private property was abolished. The injunction for monastic work was fulfilled in the tapestries and bench covers produced by the nuns between 1492-1508. In 1466 a document mentions the offices held within the convent, including the prioress, sub-prioress, and 2 choir-mistresses (Reinhardt, 390). In 1529 provost Johannes Lorber resigned under force from Duke Ernst and the Protestant Reformation. A protestant preacher was imposed upon the nuns. However, the nuns were not inclinde to accept him. They lit old felt slippers to drive out the Protestant preacher with smoke, sang during his sermons, and when ordered to be quiet, did their rosaries. They held Mass in their private quarters or in the granary (Wiesner-Hanks, 16). On October 10, 1529 they attempted to overpower his sermon through songs(Reinhardt, 384). It is likely that the convent was supported in its opposition to reform and secularization by the city council of LÃ¼neburg. Pressured by the opposition of the nuns, the duke finally promised them the priviledges of their convent and the ability to freely practice their religion. The nuns resisted the Protestant Reformation until 1573 (Riggert). LÃ¼ne was forced to accept a Protestant ordinance in 1555, which declared the convent was now an educational center for women; but the women wore Benedictine habits and described themselves as belonging to the Benedictine order until 1610 (Wiesner-Hanks, 18). The convent did not become a completely evangelical women's chapter until 1711. ; In 1172 by the convent's consecration by the bishop of Verden the convent received some relics of S. Bartholomew. His picture appeared for the first time on the convent's seal in 1274. ; The archives of this community are located in the LÃ¼neburg KlÃ¶sterarchive, SHstA Hannover, and in the Stadtarchiv LÃ¼neburg. The one illustrated manuscript extant is held in Hannover at the NiedersÃ¤chsisches Landesbibliothek, Ms. I 94 (HV4). ; Die Luneburger Frauenkloster ; [1]HODENBERG, W.v., ed.

Elizabeth in the Johanniskirche (Church of S. John) in LÃ¼neburg. The convent acquired income through its land-holdings in the form of tithes. The convent received tithes from the villages of: Addenstorf, Adendorf, Asendorf, Barendorf, Barnstedt, Barskamp, Berke II, Dibbersen, Etzen, Garlstorf, Hagen, Hittbergen, Holthusen, Holzen, LÃ¼ne, LÃ¼neburg, Meckelfeld, Munster, Niendorf bei Reinstorf, Oelstorf, Putensen, Rade, Reinstorf, Rosenthal, Rohstorf, SÃ¼lbeck, Vastorf, Volkstorf, Wendhausen, Wendisch Evern, Westerehlbeck and Wittorf. It also benefitted from fishing, wood-, and grazing- rights in the cities of Adendorf, Bleckede, Fliegenberg, Handorf, Leversen, Neetze, Rohstorf, Volkstorf, and Vrestorf. The convent held jurisdictional and administrative rights in Barendorf, Bergen, Dalldorf, Dreilingen, Handorf, Hittbergen, Hohnstorf, Kahlstorf, Rosenthal, Volkstorf, Warpke, Wendhausen, Wiecheln, and Winsen/Luhe. The convent owned mills in Ellringen, Kirchwerder, LÃ¼neburg, Wennekath and Wiecheln. The convent held farms and pasture land in the areas of Adendorf, Asendor, Bardowick, Barendorf, Bargfeld, Barum, Barskamp, Bavendorf, Bauersee Berke I and II, Betzendorf, Bilm, Bohndorf (1172-1315), Boltersen, Brietlingen, Dachtmissen, Dahlenburg, Dalldorf, Deutsch-Evern, Dreilingen (1344-1395), Droegen-Nottorf, Dumstorf, Edendorf, Ellringen, Eyendorf, Garlstorf, Gifkendorf, Hagen, Handrof, Hittbergen, Hohnstorf, Holzen, Horn, Horndorf, Kahlstorf, Karze, Kirchgellersen (1263-1329), Kirchwerder (1312-1332), KÃ¶sdorf, LÃ¼dersburg, LÃ¼ne, Meckelfeld, Neetze, Niendorf bei Medingen, Niedorf bei Neetze, Nutzfelde (after 1263), Ã–lstorf, Ã–rzen, Putensen, Rade, Radenbeck, Raetzlingen, Reinstorf, Rosenthal, Sangenstedt, Schaetzendorf, Striksikkesdale, SÃ¼dergellersen, SÃ¼lbeck, SÃ¼ttorf, Thomasburg, Toppenstedt, Uelzen, Volkstorf, Vrestorf, Wendhausen, Wendish Evern, Wennekath, Wiecheln and Wittorf (Reinhardt, 387). In contrast to the (male) cloister of S. Michaelis, LÃ¼ne did not have many properties which it loaned out as fiefs. The conventual income was comprised of agricultural production and the raising of cattle. In addition, within the cloister were employed backers, butchers, and brewers, gardeners, cattle- and sheep-herders, a smith and their servants (Reinhardt, 388). ; Benedictine (by 1284) ; A document of 1231 naming the prioress and ten nuns indicates that they all stemmed from the nobility. Already in the thirteenth century, half of the nuns of the convent stemmed from the local nobility; the other half likely came from the local bourgeousie. Most of the women came from the dukedom of LÃ¼neburg. The convent had especially close ties witht he city of LÃ¼neburg; many families from this city had female relatives in the convent (not only from the highest levels of the bourgeousie) (Reinhardt, 390). ; In 1231 the number of inhabitants was restricted to ten women (canonesses) in addition to the prioress. The number of requests to enter the convent had grown so numerous that in 1284 Bishop Konrad of Verden reduced the number of inhabitants to 60 (Reinhardt, 390). Nevertheless, mention of the number of nuns in 1393 and 1466 indicate that their number had declined. In 1393 there were 57 women, both nuns and laysisters (moniales, conversae et sorores) and in 1466 there were 27 (perhaps only referring to the number of nuns). During the final flourish of monastic life at the convent, the number of nuns climbed to 87 in 1519 (Reinhardt, 384). ; The community is located in the LÃ¼neburg Heide (Heath), close to the Ilmenau and the city of LÃ¼neburg . ; In the dukedom of LÃ¼neburg . (see foundation field) In the dukedom of Saxony (961); later in the dukedom of Braunschweig-Lueneburg (1235). ; In 1481 LÃ¼ne experienced its last flowering of monastic life; the community also underwent an internal reform in this year. It is unclear whether the convent was reformed according to the Bursfeld or Windesheim rule (Reinhardt, 383). The prioress and reformer ofÂ EbstorfÂ , Mechtild von Niendorf, came to LÃ¼ne on October 19, 1481 with seven nuns. On the following day the provost ofÂ EbstorfÂ along with the deacon of Verden, Otto Vulle, and three other religious leaders visited the convent; however, they did not ascertain any abuses or faults in the community (Reinhardt, 383). Afterwards, prioress Bertha Hoyer and the subprioress were removed however. Instead, the visitors established Sophie Bodendike and Gertrud Eltzen, both nuns ofÂ Ebstorf, in these positions. Other nuns fromÂ EbstorfÂ were placed in the offices of sacristra, cellaress, and choir-mistress (Reinhardt, 383). The nuns were also given a new father confessor. It is uncertain whether the reform of the convent resulted in the abolishment of the nuns' ability to own private property, as happened in other convents, such asÂ Wienhausen. ; No traces of the initial cloister buildings prior to the fire of 1372 exist. The foundation history relates that Hildewidis assumed possession of a previously-built stone church, consecrated to S. Mary. After the fire of 1372 the convent moved to its present location closer to the Ilmenau and the city of LÃ¼neburg (Riggert;Reinhardt, 380). The rebuilding of the convent in its new location was undertaken during the provostship of Weigergang.Â LÃ¼ne, monastic complexÂ The chapel of S. Barbara (the present sacristry) appears to be the first building undertaken after the fire of 1372. Only slightly more recent is the convent church, which was expaned to the west between 1481-1497. The nuns' choir lies in the west side of the church. At one time the church had seven different altars. Under a late flowering of monastic life during the time of Prioress Mechtild Wilde improvements were made to the cloister architecture and the decoration of the church was improved. She and provost Johannes Lorber established an altar to the 10,000 virgins, probably located on the north wall (Reinhardt, 393). The provost's chair, dated to circa 1412, has reliefs of the apostle Bartholomew and Jacob, Mary with child, and the provost Weigergang, under whom the new church was erected (Reinhardt, 394). In 1497 the convent received an organ. The dormitory lay over the refectory on the (west) side of the cloister. In 1482/3 a work-house was erected in the western portion of the cloister enclosure. Since 1500 this work-house was connected with a wash-house.Â LÃ¼ne, former wash houseÂ Circa 1509 a weaving house was also built to the south of the convent's hall. The provost's house lies outside the convent walls.Â LÃ¼ne, provost's houseÂ A building for the storage of corn was built circa 1550.Â LÃ¼ne, former corn house ; Several medieval tapestries survive from the convent of LÃ¼ne, dating from 1492-1508. The Banklaken often depict pelicans, thought to sacrifice themselves for their young, a reference to Christ(Reinhardt, 396). In both LÃ¼ne andÂ HeiningenÂ the seamstresses stiched their names or initials into the borders of the tapestries, some of which are still visible today (Appuhn, 42). The injunction for monastic work, which experienced a late revival under Prioress Mechtild Wilde, was fulfilled in the tapestries and bench covers (Banklaken) produced by the nuns between 1492-1508. From the medieval period of the nuns' choir remain a chest for holy figures/statues and 2 devotional pictures of Christ suffering, painted on linen. Two processional banners from the fifteenth century are also extant (Reinhardt, 394). The convent also retains a few stained-glass windows from the first half of the fifteenth century which depict saints. An inventory from the fifteenth century lists five silver and golden communion chalices. From the thirteenth century to the first half of the fourteenth century the nuns produced tapestries and liturgical hangings, including the still-extant four altar clothes, three (FastentÃ¼cher) Lenten altar clothes, and a white-on-white embroidery on linen (Reinhardt, 396). From 1492-1508 the convent produced four Banklaken and four large woolen embroideries, embroidered with colored wool on linen. The Banklaken depict the legends of S. Bartholomew, S. Katharine, and S. George. The Banklaken depicting the legend of Saint George is preserved in the Kestner Museum at Hannover.Â LÃ¼ne, S. George TapestryLÃ¼ne, S. George Tapestry (detail)LÃ¼ne, S. George Tapestery (detail)Â The remaining embroideries record the prophecies of the Sybils and prophets, the tree of Jesse, and the arisen Christ. The most beautiful embroidery depicts the Easter story. This famous embroidery is now held in the Hamburg Museum for Art and Trade and is exhibited between Easter and Pentecost. This large tapestry, done in colored wool on a linen background, stretches 475x420cm. The tapestry was originally embroidered by the nuns of the convent in thirteenth different colors, although the work has now faded. The tapestry depicts Christ arising from his tomb within several concentric circles of stars, angels, and phases of the moon. The image is surrounded by bands of text in Latin, taken from the Bible, the Easter liturgy, and hymns. The arisen Christ is surrounded by a band of seven stars and seven angels, perhaps signifying the seven canonical hours or the seven days in the Creation story. The angels are depicted playing a variety of medieval instruments. A larger circle depicting the phases of the moon and indicating the days and months of the year encircles the angels and stars. Underneath the central medallion is a tree with a bird. Two angels stand on either side. In the corners of the embroidery, allegorical animals are depicted: an eagle, a phoenix, a pelican, and a lion, all symbolically associated with Christ. The edges of the embroidery depict roses and mythical creatures. According to Horst Appuhn, the theme of the embroidery turns from the celebration of Easter and the Arisen Christ (in the center) to a joyful celebration of spring in nature (on the edges) (Hamburg Museum fÃ¼r Kunst und Gewebe: Der Osterteppich aus Kloster LÃ¼ne., 982). The work includes the initials of the seamstresses as well as the heraldic symbols of Provosts Nikolaus Schomaker and Lorbeer and prioresses Sophia von Bodendik and Mechtild Wilde. The works was begun in 1504 and completed in 1508 (see contributors notes). The style of the figures perhaps show a Norman influence (Hamburg Museum fÃ¼r Kunst und Gewebe: Der Osterteppich aus Kloster LÃ¼ne., 983). The convent seal is round and depicts S. Bartholomew standing with a nimbus and full beard. In his raised right hand, he holds a gospel, and in his left hand there is a flag with the words: S[anctus] Bartholomeus. This flag curls around under his feet to his right hand. Individual provosts of the community had their own individual seals (Reinhardt, 401). Only one illustrated manuscript produced by the community is extant; it has an illustration of the Annunciation (see literary works). ; Part of the text on the famous Easter Tapestry reads: ""In the year of the virgin birth 1504 the noble Domina, the prioress Sophia von Bodendik, oversaw the embroidering of this tapestry through the hands of the nuns living at LÃ¼ne at that time for the worship of God and his beloved mother Mary and also the saint Bartholomew, the kingly apostles, [and] our glorious patron, in the twenty-third year of the reform of this convent. And in the same year the noble Domina piously departed this life. Her soul rests in peace, Amen."" According to Horst Appuhn, between 1492 and 1508 the nuns at LÃ¼ne embroidered no less than 85 square meters. Appuhn links this remarkable effort to the Catholic reform undertaken in 1481 and the renewed adherence to the Benedictine rule, specifically the ora and labora it proscribes. Appuhn also contends that such massive embroidery works would have required the building of a workshop within the monastic enclosure. He also states that the nuns received sweets as a reward from the prioress upon the completion of such a work (Hamburg Museum fÃ¼r Kunst und Gewebe: Der Osterteppich aus Kloster LÃ¼ne., 983). Since 1711 the community has functioned as a noble protestant women's chapter. The convent was dissolved briefly in the Napoleonic era in 1812/13 but was reestablished after the French withdrew. The convent continues as a noble women's chapter. Information about the convent can be found on the website for the city of LÃ¼ne atÂ lueneburg.deÂ The convent exibits its artistic treasures on the week of S. Bartholomew's day (August 24). ; The convent probably had a scriptorium in the Middle Ages, but few manuscripts are extant. During the fifteenth century, many books were exchanged between this convent andÂ Ebstorf. Only one illustrated manuscript from the convent still exists in the NiedersÃ¤chsisches Landesbibliothek in Hannover, Ms. I 94 (HV4). The work contains an illuminated picture of the Annunciation. The work stems from the fifteenth century (Uhde-Stahl, 30-31). ; Patrons of the community were the neigboring nobles of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg and the LÃ¼neburg bourgeousie. ; Hildewidis von Marcboldestorpe was the first prioress in 1172. Known prioresses of the community are: Gertrudis (1231); Oldegardis (1284, 1289); Gissa (Gisle, Ghisla) (1299, 1315); Elisabeth (1318, 1329); Lutgarda (1330, 1337); Gertrudis (1339); Alheyd von Barfelde (1341, 1346); Ghyseltrudis Willeri (1349, 1357); Richza (Rixa) (1362, 1369); Mechtildis (1370); Wicburgis (1374); Kunegundis (1375); Mechtildis (1382, 1412); Drude Semmelbecker (1415, 1422); Helena von meding (1436, 1446); Gebeke Moller (1448, 1450); Gertrudis Schomaker (1450); Susanne Munter (1451); Mette von dem Berge (1458, 1468); Berta Hoywe (1468-1481); Sophia von Bodendike (1481-1504); Mechtild Wilde (1504-1435); Elisabeth Schneverding (1535-1540); and Katharina Semmelbecker (1540-1562). ; The convent still exists. ; The convent had close ties to the city of LÃ¼neburg, for its provost numbered among the ""Salt-prelates"" since 1229; the members helped to elect the ""Sodmeister,"" the highest administrative office of the LÃ¼neburg salt works (Reinhardt, 379). Provost Johannes Weigergang was politically active in the LÃ¼neburger city council and dukedom of LÃ¼neburg. He was frequently active in arbitrations between the city and the dukes. Since 1404 he was also a judge in Modestorp along with the abbots of S. Michaelis and Scharnebeck (Reinhardt, 380). He also served dukes Wenceslaus and Albrecth as chaplain in the fifteenth century (Reinhardt, 381). In 1472 the city of LÃ¼neburg safeguarded its protection of the convent, particularly regarding the election of its provosts and the dangers of war (Reinhardt, 383).";FAUX

After his death, Gernrode andÂ FroseÂ inherited all his possessions and holdings. Circa 1200 the community drew up a manuscript listing all its rights of ownership, dependencies, and holdings. According to this manuscript 24 entire villages, 21 churches, and nearly 400 hides of land belonged to the communities of Gernrode andÂ Frose. Although the manuscript is a forgery (it purports to be a document issued by Margrave Gero in 964), it was accepted and strengthened by Pope Innocent III and was accepted as the truth thereafter. Although the manuscript does not record Gero's original bequest, it does reflect the communities' holdings circa 1200. At the height of their wealth, the communities ofÂ FroseÂ and Gernrode held approximately 1,000 hides of land (11,000 hectares), comprising woodland, vineyards, fish ponds, and grazing. From the thirteenth century on, the community suffered from debts, poor management by its abbesses, divisions within the chapter, the poor economic conditions of the later Middle Ages, and the aggressive territorial politics of the archbishop of Magdeburg and the bishops of Halberstadt. The community gradually lost both goods and tenants. By 1544, its possessions encompassed only Gernrode itself, 5 villages, and some abandoned fields. ; Gernrode andÂ FroseÂ were among the richest land holders in the Eastern Harz region. ; A document issued on August 5, 1352 recorded a donation of 30 Marks to the community by two of its canonesses, Agnes de Merwitz (referred to as a deaconess, decana) and Margareta de Warin (referred to as a concanonica) in order to rebuild a deserted home located close to the dormitory, which should serve as the summer dormitory. ; Tenants of the community provided yearly from one to six days of service, as well as hunting and transport services to the community. From the thirteenth century on, these service requirements could be exchanged for a monetary payment to the community. Due to the plagues and famines of the fifteenth century, Gernrode had difficulty finding people to work its land, and the abbess and chapter had to lower their expectations and demands in order to attract new tenants. Traditionally, the community demanded payments at the death of its vassals. A peasant farmer from either Alsleben or Alikendorf was required to turn over half of their property to the abbess and chapter upon death. It was traditional at the death of the man to convey the best chattel to the community, at the death of the woman, the best dress. The death taxes of the Gernrode canonesses were greater than most. In 1525 the dependents of the community revolted against an increase in fees and services, but they were not successful against Abbess Elisabeth von Weida. The abbess appointed administrators to oversee the community's agricultural land. Although little is known about the duties of these appointees, by the thirteenth century, these positions were hereditary. Members of powerful ministerial families competed for these positions. The position of advocate for the community was particularly important and lucrative, and the local nobility competed for this positon. From the twelfth century, the Askan family and the counts of Ballenstedt controlled the advocacy for Gernrode as a hereditary right. Despite attempts by the abbesses to regain control over the advocacy, they were not able to do so.";"1363 ; Gernrode am Harz ; The community was founded circa 959-961 by Margrave Gero I on his property. After the death of his two sons, Gero founded this community of canonesses to pray for the salvation of his family. In the charter of foundation issued in 961, memorial purposes are listed as the primary motivation for the establishment of the house. He appointed his daughter-in-law Hathui as the first abbess. ; From 1521 until 1610 the community continued as a noble women's chapter, although it had ceased to follow the regulations of the Benedictine order. The last abbess of the community, Sophia Elisabeth von Anhalt died in 1604. In 1616 the princes of Anhalt divided the protectorship and possessions of the community among themselves. ; Gero brought an arm bone from Saint Cyriacus and a unspecified bone relic of Saint Matronus back to the community after his pilgrimage to Rome. (The relics may have been stolen or it is possible that they were given to Gero by Bishop Rathers of Verona if he was present at his consecration in 961. The ""theft"" of the relics was not discovered in Verona until January 27, 962). Matronus was a layman who lived in the tenth century in Verona. The veneration of Saint Matronus is confined to Verona and Gernrode. An altar dedicated to Saint Matronus was dedicated in the western choir. A fifteenth century breviary contains the only complete office for the celebration of Saint Matronus as well as a brief vita. The breviary was commissioned in 1487 specifically for use in Gernrode. These relics were taken away during the Reformation. The first abbess, Hathui, was honored as a holy woman, over whose grave miracles occurred, within the community. ; This community was founded as a dependency ofÂ QuedlinburgÂ in 961? ; Since the tenth century, the community had at least a small library. In 1500 the medieval library was disbanded. A few liturgical manuscripts are still extant. After 1530 a new library was assembled. This library is preserved largely in tact in the Anhaltischen Landesbucherei in Dessau. A lectionary and antiphonals, the vigil book, a breviary, and a processional (all dating to the fifteenth century) are among the extant works. The Staatsbibliothek PreuÃŸischer Kulturbesitz preserves a processional from the community, later held inÂ Quedlinburg, (dating circa 1502), #Mus. 40081. It is this manuscript that preserves the Easter play and processional. This manuscript was discovered by Walter Lipphardt in 1972. This library also preserves a theological manuscript from Eppenberg, #Theol. lat. 4o348. The City library in Dessau contains two manuscripts from the house, #BB 3613 and #BB 3944 ""De matrimonio non c(on)trahendo"" (c. 1454). The Herzoglisches Gipskammer in Dessau contains two works that belonged to the community: a tenth-century Bible, (#Bruchst. 2); and a manuscript of Hrabanus Maurus's ""In Leviticum"" (10th c.), which deals with the sexual regulations set forth in this text, (#Bruchst. 3). Some documents from the community are held in the archive for Anhalt (Anhaltisches Gesamtarchiv). A book of vigils from the community is still extant, which lists more than 130 persons for whom the canonesses held vigils. This is preserved in the Anhaltisches Gesamtarchiv. A commentary on the Psalms, created in the tenth century at the community ofÂ Essen, later came into the possession of the canonesses. It may have arrived at Gernrode by means of Abbess Hathui or Adelheid. The manuscript indicates that the canonesses were actively teaching the psalms in the tenth century. ; Handschriftenerbe des Deutschen Mittelalters, vol. 1, p. 292. ; The first abbess was Margrave Gero's daughter-in-law, Hathui. After the death of Hathui, Heinrich II appointed Adelheid, the sister of Otto III, as her successor in 1014. After Adelheid (d. 1043) followed Hazecha, a decendent of Gero's brother, Siegfried. In this early period, the descendents of Gero's family and families associated with it, particularly the Askan and Wettin families, often assumed the position of abbess within Gernrode. The abbess ofÂ QuedlinburgÂ was appointed by Henry I as abbess of Gernrode and its dependency ofÂ FroseÂ (McNamara, 198). ; In 1325 a school mistress (scholastica) is mentioned. ; Since the eleventh century the property of Gernrode was divided between the abbess, the canonesses, and the other inhabitants of the chapter. The canonesses administered only a small portion of their land holdings directly. They leased the lands to dependent farmers in return for rent payments and services. The majority of the community's land was loaned in fief to vassals and members of ministerial families. ; The community served as a burial place for members of Gero's family. In Gernrode andÂ FroseÂ the canonesses' privelege of eating meat and cheese was recorded in a document issued by Emperor Otto II. Such a privilege indicates the canonesses' aristocratic origins. White habits (albis vestibus) are indicated forÂ FroseÂ and probably were also worn by the canonesses at Gernrode. ; Gernrode; in the region of Quedlinburg ; Gernrode; in the region of Quedlinburg ; Few details of the building history survive. Presumably, the building first began as early as 959, but the date of its consecration is unknown. The oldest part of the church is the eastern crypt with the choir above. A Westwerk with three towers was presumably erected during the abbacy of Hathui in the tenth century. The church's appearance circa 1000 would have been different than it exists today. The interior would have been smaller, primarily because of the inner wall of the Westwerk. The interior was presumably painted. Under abbess Hedwig III (1118-1152) the western portion of the church was rebuilt. Two side aisles were added, and the outer cloister was completed. The church is a three-naved basilica with a short transept. The eastern portion of the church is the oldest and remains largely original.Â Gernrode, church of S. CyriacÂ The western portion of the church, however, underwent changes in the mid-twelfth century. These changes resulted in the canonesses' use of a southern choir for their daily prayers and hours. A larger square tower originally sat between the two round towers, which were smaller and served as towers for the staircases. Circa 1130, this tower was removed and the two side towers were built higher and given pointed roofs. Between the two towers are housed the two bells of the church.Gernrode, cloisterÂ The cloister was built circa 1170, as was the corridor along the southern side of the church.Â Gernrode, cloister (detail)Â Gernrode cloister (interior)Â Gernrode, capital (detail)Â The west crypt, built circa 1130, is vaulted and supported by eight pillars. Three windows with rounded arches, located in the western wall of the crypt, provide light. This western crypt was first mentioned in 1149. According to a reference circa 1300, it held the relics of Saint Metronus.Â Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac (crypt)Â To preserve the relics of Saint Cyriacus, a holy grave (confessio) was built in the East crypt of the church. Another holy sepulcher existed by the eleventh century in the south aisle of the nave (see Art/Artifacts above). A dormitory was first mentioned in 1352. A document issued on August 5, 1352 recorded a donation of 30 Marks to the community by two of its canonesses, Agnes de Merwitz (referred to as a deaconess, decana) and Margareta de Warin (referred to as a concanonica) in order to rebuild a deserted home located close to the dormitory, which should serve as the summer dormitory. A refectory is first mentioned in 1344, when the election of the abbess was held there. It appears that the community did not have a chapter house but used the refectory for assemblies. The canonesses inÂ FroseÂ obtained permission from Emperor Otto II to live in individual dwellings. The canonesses of Gernrode may have also had personal rooms that they used, at least during the daytime. The community's liturgical books and objects along with the archive were preserved in the sacristry, located in the choir of the northern transept. ; The church paintings were added in the thirteenth century and restored in 1864. The painting in the east apse depicts Christ Pantokrator, i.e. he is seated on a throne, holding the book of life, reigning over heaven and earth. The figures depicted beneath him are the saints of the church and at the lowest level, the founder Margrave Gero, his sons and brother, and the first abbess. These murals were rather ""freely"" restored in the nineteenth century; it is unclear how accurate they are as representations of the original thirteenth-century images.Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac (interior)Â The baptismal font of Saint Cyriac at Gernrode was created circa 1150. The images carved around the baptismal depict the birth, death, and ascension of Christ.Â Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac, baptismalÂ The holy sepulcher in the church of Saint Cyriac in Gernrode is located in the southern aisle of the nave. It was created circa 1060-1080, perhaps extended and completed no later than circa 1130.Â Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac, SepulcherÂ Written references to the sepulcher first appear in the mid-fifteenth century. The sepulcher was presumably used in conjunction with Easter plays and processionals; one from Gernrode, dating from 1502, is still extant. On Black Friday the cross was carried to the grave and deposited within it (Depositio). On Easter morning it was raised again from the grave by the canons (Elevatio). Then followed a re-enactment of Christ and the three Marys at the Grave (the Visitatio), performed by the canons and canonesses. The performance ended with a procession. The north wall of the sepulcher depicts the symbols of the Evangelists; next to this is portrayed the journey of Peter and John to the grave. Continuing on the northern side of the sepulcher depicts the meeting between Jesus and Mary Magdalene (the Noli(te) me tangere scene). Over this scene is the (presently decapitated) figure of Christ as God the father with the book of life and his hand raised in blessing.Â Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac, Sepulcher (detail of northern wall)Â The west wall of the sepulcher contains the most sculptural decorations. The top contains a frieze with animals, vines, fruit, and leaves; in the middle stands a female figure between two pillars, perhaps the lamenting Mary as in John 20:11 ""she stood outside before the grave, weeping."" In the middle of the frieze is an image of the lamb of God with a nimbus and cross to each side are depicted Moses with the laws and John the Baptist. Many of the animals depicted are symbolic representations of Christ; a Pelican and Giffon, a Lion and Stag all appear. Below them are depicted: a bear, followed by a basilica, two birds next to the tree of life, a hare and a rooster, and finally a goose (?).Â Gernrode, church of S. Cyriac, Sepulcher (detail of the western wall)Â Sculptural reliefs also decorate the inside of the sepulcher. A large niche in the southern wall, surrounded by two pillars, probably served as the grave. In the course of expansion, this was relocated to the northern wall of the sepulcher. Two guardian angels and the three Marys are depicted around the grave opening. Across from the entrance is the sculpture of a figure with a pallium, which may be a bishop or perhaps another depiction of a triumphant Christ. The pillars seem to indicate a construction date of circa 1100. ; Frose ; The convent's library was transferred to Bernburg in 1662 and to Dessau in 1715. ; No evidence of a scriptorium having existed at Gernrode has come to light. Abbess Hathui, however, did commission a life of Saint Cyriacus from a cleric named Nadda. ; A processional from the sixteenth century, a Bible from the tenth century, and a tenth-century manuscript by Hrabanus Maurus are some of the more notable survivals from the convent's libary. (see manuscript sources) ; In 961 Gero arranged for Otto the Great to accept the community under his protection. Otto also provided the community with legal autonomy (immunity) and the right to freely elect its abbesses and advocates. The convent's extant book of vigils lists over 130 persons for whom the community held vigils. ; Quedlinburg ; The first abbess, Hathui, was born circa 936 into the Saxon noble family of Billung. She married Siegfried, the son of Margrave Gero, circa 954. When Siegfried died in 961, Gero appointed Hathui abbess of Gernrode. In 962 her appointment was confirmed by Bishop Bernhard of Halberstadt. Hathui was active in the care and education of the young women who entered this community. She led the community as abbess for 52 years. She successfully reestablished friendly relations between her family and emperors Otto I and II, resulting in her invitation to many imperial celebrations. In 999 Hathui was present at the elevation of Adelheid, the sister of Otto III, as abbess ofÂ Quedlinburg. Hathui also served as the head ofÂ VredenÂ since 994, which was founded by her family previously. When Hathui died on July 14, 1014, the canonesses buried her in the church before the altar dedicated to the Holy Cross next to her father-in-law, Gero. According to Thietmar's account, miracles began to occur at her tomb. She thus was honored as a holy woman in Gernrode. ; The church of the community with a portion of the cloister still exists. It stands as one of the best preserved examples of Ottonian architecture in Germany, although the church has been rebuilt and restored several times. ; On a pilgrimage to Rome, Gero conveyed the foundation of Gernrode to the papacy. Pope John XII placed the community under papal authority and transferred control over the community to the bishops of Halberstadt. During the Ottonian period, Gernrode numbered among the most famous Ottonian female foundations, includingÂ Quedlinburg,Â Gandersheim,Â EssenÂ andÂ Vreden. Gernrode andÂ QuedlinburgÂ had a spiritual consorority, in which they commemorated each community's dead. ; The abbesses of Gernrode had many ties to the imperial family during the Salian, Ottonian, and Staufer dynasties. (See in particular, Abbess Hathui-under First Members). These ties resulted in grants of imperial protection and legal rights, such as immunity and the free election of advocate and abbess. In return the convent provided hospitality to traveling emperors and their dependents. Since Otto I placed Gernrode under his imperial protection on June 17, 961, the canonesses were required to pray for his salvation and that of his sons as well as provide hospitality for the king and his retinue. Few records of imperial visits are recorded. Only records of Kunigunde, wife of King Henry II, as well as visits by King Henry V and Emperor Frederick I are recorded. Queen Kunigunde visited Gernrode on Palm Sunday of 1004 accompanied by Archbishop Taginos of Magdeburg and Thietmar, future bishop of Merseburg. She celebrated Mass with Abbess Hathui and then traveled on to Madgeburg. From the end of the twelfth century, the Saxon advocates from the house of the Askan, later the princes of Anhalt, assumed the position of protectors over the community in place of the king. From November 20-25, 1188 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa held court in Gernrode. In addition to issuing three manuscripts, he granted a bell to the church in Gernrode, presumably the bell still preserved at the church of St. Stephan. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the abbesses again tried to establish imperial privileges for their community. Sigmund, Frederick III, Karl V, Maximillian II, and Rudolf II all confirmed the rights of the community and the appointment of its abbesses. ; The canons of the community dwelt in their own apartments outside of the confines of the chapter.";FAUX

Here are the key details:

Name: Certosa di San Girolamo (Saint Jerome's Charterhouse), also commonly called Certosa di Parma or Certosa di Valserena.
Order: Carthusian.
Location: It is situated a few kilometers northwest of the city of Parma, in the locality of Paradigna (Valserena). So, not directly within the city walls of Parma itself, but closely associated with it.
Foundation: It was founded in 1285 by Ugolino da Neviano, Bishop of Parma, though other noble families were also involved in its patronage over time.
Dedication: To Saint Jerome (San Girolamo).
History:
It was a significant and wealthy Carthusian monastery for centuries.
Like many monastic institutions, it underwent various phases of construction, expansion, and artistic embellishment.
It was suppressed during the Napoleonic era in the early 19th century (around 1805-1810).
After suppression, the complex was used for various purposes, including as a tobacco factory and for other industrial or agricultural uses. Some parts fell into disrepair.
Literary Fame: The Certosa di Parma is perhaps most famously known internationally as the (fictionalized) setting and title of the novel ""La Chartreuse de Parme"" (The Charterhouse of Parma) by the French author Stendhal, published in 1839. While Stendhal's novel is a work of fiction and takes considerable liberties with the actual location and historical Carthusian life, the historical Certosa di San Girolamo is widely considered his inspiration.
Current Status:
The Certosa is no longer an active monastery.
A significant part of the complex has been restored and is now home to the CSAC (Centro Studi e Archivio della Comunicazione) of the University of Parma. This center houses vast archives and collections related to Italian art, photography, design, and media from the 20th century onwards.
Parts of the complex, including the church and some of the cloisters, can be visited. It remains an impressive architectural site.";

The convent was plundered during the Peasant's Revolt.;"4839 ; The exact date of the foundation of this, the oldest and richest of the Frankish Cistercian convents, can not be definitely determined. According to Krausen, the convent was founded by Embricho von Leiningen, the Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg with King Konrad III serving as a co-founder (Krausen, 104). Link, however, ascribes the foundation to Counts Popo and Gebhard of Henneberg, whose sister was the first abbess of the community (Link, 576). The foundation was consecrated by Bishop Emerich in 1143, and in 1144 the convent was confirmed by Pope Lucius III. The bishop served as advocate for the convent and the provost was supposed to be a member of the cathedral chapter of WÃ¼rzburg. The community assumed the Benedictine rule. The nuns later assumed the strict observances of the Cistercian order. Nevertheless, the convent was never formally incorporated into the Cistercian order. The document of papal protection from Pope Eugens III of 1150 first mentions S. Mary as the patron of the convent, and an undated document from Alexander IV refers to the convent assuming Cistercian customs at the great council of Lyon (Krausen, 104). ; The convent had disputes over its property and also declined in adherence to its original rule: individual nuns held their own property and noble relatives mixed with the nuns in the convent (Krausen, 104). Bishop Rudolf von Scherenberg attempted to reform the convent since 1480. Link also refers to the nuns' reputation for dissorderliness and disobedience to the original rule (Link, 578). According to Link, Bishop Albert had to threaten the nuns with excommunication in order to enforce their obedience to the provost! The nuns fled the convent as a result of the Peasant Uprising of 1525, only partially returning after the convent's plundering. In 1552 Margrave Albrecht Alkibiades burnt the convent. Attempts to reestablish the convnet with help from the nuns ofÂ HimmelspfortenÂ andÂ OberschÃ¶nenfeldÂ were unsuccessful. In 1574, after the death of the last nun Marie of Hornau, nuns from OberschÃ¶nfeld in Swabia (perhaps a reference toÂ OberschÃ¶nenfeldÂ ?) were called to the convent, where they established a girls' school. The nuns soon returned to their mother-house for lack of provisions. In 1592 the convent was finally dissolved by Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, the Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg, with papal approval. The assets of the community formed the basis for the foundation of the parish and school. ; I am uncertain whether the references to Oberschonfeld in Schwabia and Oberschonenfeld in Bavaria by Link and Krausen respectively refer to the same convent.

In 1233 he bestowed fifteen fields free of tithes in Wienhausen as well as tithes in several other towns to the convent. He also granted the community a hide in Oppershausen as well as the church in Westercelle with its income. Wienhausen held tithes in the villages of Bockelskamp, Flackenhorst, Bennebostel, Bostel and Lachtehausen. Duchess Agnes acquired from the noble Hermann von Meinersen half of the right of patronage in the church at GroÃŸ Hehlen, four farms, and six cottages. She also acquired a farm in Klein Hehlen, three farms and a mill in Boye and half of all payments and tolls in HambÃ¼hren as well as farms in Wittbeck and Belson, and two farms in Garssen. Duke Otto granted the convent a saltpan in the LÃ¼neburg saltworks, four houses in Gockenholz and the income of Ottenhause, which lay west of the convent. He also gave the convent authority in the village of Nienhagen. Duchess Mathilde, the widow of Otto, continued his patronage by granting the convent toll and tax exemptions on all the goods sold in LÃ¼neburg. She also gave the convent four and a half lots of salt from the LÃ¼neburg saltworks. By 1368 the entire villages of Nienhagen, Wiedenrode and Sandlingen were incorporated in the convent's possessions. It also acquired possession in sixteen villages to the south of Wienhausen as well as seven hides in Haenigsen, Dollbergen and Ã–lerse. The convent acquired tithes in the villages northwest of Burgdorf as well as held tithes and landholdings in large numbers in Sievershausen and around Hohenhameln. ; The convent appears to have been relatively wealthy. ; The nuns may have contributed to the income of the convent by producing and selling tapestries and embroidery work. Throughout the medieval period the convents in the region of LÃ¼neburg were renown for their silk, linen, and wool embroidery. The renovations of the S. Anne's Chapel in 1510 were paid for by the sale of handwork.";"11807 ; Huginhusen; Hvinhusen; Winhusen; Wingehusen; Wynhussen ; No foundation charter exists for this community, but its foundation can be reconstructed from the convent chronicle and other documents. The convent was founded between 1221 and 1228 by Duchess Agnes of Landsberg-Meissen, the widow of Henry (Heinrich), duke of Saxony and count-palantine of the Rhine, and son of Henry the Lion (Heinrich des LÃ¶wen). (She also founded the convent ofÂ Isenhagen). Although the actual date of foundation differs, it is likely that Agnes founded the convent as a means of salvation for her sins and those of her deceased husband (Leerhoff, 757). Both are portrayed in the paintings that decorate the nuns' choir.Â Wienhausen, Nuns' choir detail of the convent's foundersÂ The first nuns for the community came from the convent ofÂ WÃ¶ltingerodeÂ in the bishopric of Hildesheim (Riggert). The foundation of the convent recieved much support from bishop Conrad of Hildesheim, who provided for the community both economically and spiritually. The convent was first established in Nienhagen; it moved eight or ten years later (circa 1231) due to mosquitoes, ""poisonous worms,"" and bad air. It settled in Wienhausen. In 1233 the convent was officially transferred to the church in Wienhausen by Bishop Conrad. A document dated April 24, 1233 confirmed the institution of the convent in Wienhausen. In 1244 Duke Otto requested the convent's incorporation into the Cistercian Order. Much debate revolves around whether Wienhausen was actually encorporated into the order. The request survives but not the answer. The continuing active role of the bishops of Hildesheim indicates a lack of formal incorporation, although the chapter supposedly placed Wienhausen under the supervision of the male Cistercian house of Riddagshausen and gave the abbots of Locum an Michaelstein the task of visistation. In light of evidence on both sides, most scholars agree that Wienhausen followed Cistercian customs but was likely not formally incorporated into the order. ; In 1349-50 the convent suffered economic difficulties due to the plague, a conflict between rival bishops of Hildesheim and the LÃ¼neburg succession war. At this time the convent built a chapel to the saints Sebastian and Fabian, who were closely associated with the plague and its cure. The nuns appealed to family and friends for support and sold emroidery and other handiwork to supplement the community's income. To ameliorate the convent's condition, in 1352 the provost granted the convent rents from three houses in his possession. In 1469 the convent undertook an internal reform at the request of Duke Otto II. The nuns mounted substantial resistance, under Abbess Katharina von Hoya, to the reformers' attempts to re-impose the vita communis. In the course of the reform Katharina was removed from the abbecy and sent to the convent of Dernebach. The reform resulted in the dispersion of several objects from Wienhausen, primarily personal possessions. In 1529 the duke attempted to impose the Lutheran Reformation against the subustantial resistance of the nuns. In the course of the conflict, the duke even knocked down a portion of the convent, (the eastern wing). This eastern wing was rebuilt in the sixteenth century. SeeÂ Wienhausen, eastern rangeÂ The first Lutheran pastor was sent to the convent in 1529, and the Duke of Brunswick later took away much of the convent's land and all its prayer books. In 1549 the convent finally accepted the Lutheran reform. In 1587 the last catholic abbess died, and in 1651 the first woman willingly left the convent to marry (Wiesner-Hanks, 18). ; The convent has a relic of a drop of Christ's holy blood, which Duchess Agnes brought back from Rome. Other relics from unknown saints were discovered under the floorboards of the nun's choir in the 1950s. ; LUENTZEL, Geschichte der Dioezese und der Stadt Hildesheim I, 536. ; The archives for the convent are located in the LÃ¼neburg KlÃ¶sterarchive at Wienhausen, including the illustrated processional.

The only surviving register of the convent's tithes, dating from 1340, records income from tithes in forty-five locations as well as income from landed possessions in fifty-seven places. Income in the LÃ¼neburg saltworks comprised an important part of the convent's finances. In comparison to the other convents in the area, Wienhausen's salt possessions are average.Â EbstorfÂ possessed five times as many holdings, while the convents ofÂ MedingenÂ andÂ WalsrodeÂ held three times as many.Â IsenhagenÂ had a fourth less rights in the saltworks than Wienhausen. The convent also held partronage rights in the churches in Westercelle, Nienhagen, and Berkum as well as half of the patronage in the church in GroÃŸ Hehlen. In 1378 it acquired the right of partonage in the parish church of Broeckel, which was later incorporated into Wienhausen. The abbesses of Wienhausen also held patronage rights over the various chapels within the convent. In total Wienhausen had patronage rights in six churches, besides those within the confines of the convent itself (Leerhoff, 775). The parish churches of Westercelle, Berkum and BrÃ¶ckel were incorporated. ; In 1476 the bishop of Hildesheim ended a conflict between the provost and the abbess and nuns in which the provost had hindered the levying of monetary contributions in the chruches of Wienhausen and BrÃ¶ckel. The bishop ruled in favor of the convent (Leerhoff, 770). ; Benedictine ; The community was composed of women from the local nobility and urban patriciate. During the abbacy of Susanna Potstock (1470-1501) twenty-one of the forty-eight deceased nuns recorded in the convent Necrology stemmed from noble families. In 1547 seventy nuns came from the nobility. Six abbesses had direct connections to the ruling family of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg. Both Agnes and Mathilde retired to Wienhausen as widows. Duke Ludwig is buried in Wienhausen as is the heart of Duchess Magdalena, wife of Duke Friedrich the pious. The abbesses of the community stemmed predominantly from the nobility. ; The nuns' choir, built circa 1330, had eighty-nine seats, but the population was probably lower than this during most periods. A document from 1431 indicates thirty nuns and their attendants. In the sixteenth century, the number of nuns sank to twenty-six and remained constant until the twentieth century (Leerhoff, 771). ; In the governmental district of LÃ¼neburg ; in the administrative district of Celle. ; The convent was originally founded in Nienhagen, ten km south of Celle. It later moved to the location of Wienhausen. ; In 1469 the abbot of S. Michael and S. Godehard in Hildesheim made a visitation to the convent for the purpose of reform; Abbess Sophia von Schulenburg from the reformed convent of Derneburg accompanied the bishop. The vistors' report stated that the nuns upheld their vows of chastity, but many owned private possessions. The nuns mounted substantial resistance, under Abbess Katharina von Hoya, to the reformers' attempts to re-impose the vita communis. The reformers' also ordered the nuns to abandon their secular singing and follow the Cistercian customs in all aspects of monastic life. ; The convent was repeatedly damaged by fires. However, the standing buildings stem largely from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. Wienhausen provides a perfect example of the northern Gothic Brick style. The convent church is built in the Gothic style with a nuns' choir built on the second level of the western side of the church.Â Wienhausen, exterior view of nuns' choirÂ In the period of the plague the convent built a chapel to Saints Sebastian and Fabian. Under the abbess Margareta von SchÃ¶ningen (circa 1302-1317) and the Provost Dietrich von Prome the west wing, which housed the winter refectory was built.Â Wienhausen, western range (south facade)Wienhausen, western rangeÂ An existing mural in the convent records their extension of the convent.Â Wienhausen, Dedication muralÂ Under the abbecy of Katharina von Hoya the summer refectory and new dormitory were erected in the north wing of the cloister, the sarcophagus for the Grabchristus was produced, and a chapel to St. Anne was erected and outfitted between 1422-1433. In the Middle Ages the convent had at least seven different chapels within its confines. The various chapels were dedicated to Simon and Judas, Benedict, the Holy Cross, S. Anne, S. Fabian and Sebastian, an infirmary chapel, and the All-Saints' chapel. Only the All-Saints' chapel remains intact. (See state of Medieval Buildings) The eastern wing of the monastic complex was torn down by the Duke Ernst of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg circa 1530, but was later rebuilt.Â Wienhausen, eastern range ; The most famous artwork at Wienhausen are the paintings in the nuns' choir.Â Wienhausen, Nuns' choirÂ These paintings, completed circa 1335, depict scenes from the Old and New Testament, sucha asÂ Wienhausen, Nuns' choir sacrifice of Jacob by IsaacÂ andÂ Wienhausen, Nuns' choir detail of the Egyptians drowning in the red sea, images of the saints, such asÂ Wienhausen, nuns' choir, detail of S.

Some of the images, such as the depiction of Christ as a heavenly bridegroom, may have reflected mystical trends.Â Wienhausen, Nuns' choir detail of Christ as the heavenly bridegroomÂ In 1488 the paintings were restored by three nuns under the direction of the Abbess Susanna Potstock. Artistically Wienhausen experienced three highpoints: from 1292-1349/50; 1422-1474; and 1500-1528. The convent preserves stained glass windows from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries; the most famous of these depicts the crucifixion of Christ by the virtues.Â Wienhausen, Christ crucified surrounded by the virtuesÂ Others portray Christ's entry into JerusalemÂ Wienhausen, Christ's entry to Jerusalem, the last supper, the ResurrectionÂ Wienhausen, Arisen Christ (stained glass), and the noli me tangere scene of Christ and Mary in the garden. One of particular interest portrays Christ prepared for burial with a nun in a white habit praying below the tomb in the traditional position of the patron's portrait.Â Wienhausen, Christ's burial (stained glass)Â The earliest portion of the convent, the chapel dedicated to All Saints built in the thirteenth century, also preserves the oldest stained glass windows in the convent. Two windows of four panels depict Christ's crucifixion and resurrection with images of Saint Michael and the annunciation below.Â Wienhausen, All Saints Chapel (stained glass)Wienhausen, Crucifixion (stained glass) detailÂ The convent is also famous for its statues, including the thirteenth-century figures of the convent's founder, Agnes,Â Wienhausen, Agnes of Landsberg; an effigy of Christ, or GrabchristusÂ Wienhausen, Effigy of Christ; the Arisen ChristÂ Wienhausen, Arisen Christ (statue); and the enthroned madonna (circa 1290)Â Wienhausen, Madonna with Christ child. The convent preserves several medieval embroideries.

The nuns also produced diminuative robes for the statues of Mary and the other saints belonging to their convent. Thirteen such robes are preserved at Wienhausen.Â Wienhausen, robe for statueWienhausen, robe for statueÂ The sarcophagus for Christ's effigy, produced under Abbess Katharina von Hoya, depicts scenes from the life of Christ. It was painted circa 1420. During renovation of the nuns' choir in the 1950s several small devotional pictures, or Andachtsbilder, were discovered as well as small hand-held looms, thimbles, pilgrimage amulets, and even a pair of eyeglasses! Among the most richly illuminated devotional images discovered was an image depicting the community's statue of the Arisen Christ,Â Wienhausen, Arisen Christ (devotional image). The devotional image portrays the statue of the figure of the Arisen Christ, surrounded by prayers and hymns. Another devotional image portrays a youthful Christ enthroned in a mandorla.Â Wienhausen, Christ enthroned in mandorlaÂ A third recalls the wooden effigy of Christ owned by the community.Â Wienhausen, Christ prepared for burial (devotional image)Â A colored drawing on paper, dating to circa 1470, depicted a Cistercian nun, wearing the habit typical of the Cistercian convents in this region, kneeling in prayer before Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim.Â Wienhausen, Cistercian nun with Bishop Bernward of HildesheimÂ An thirteenth-century image depicted a youthful Christ led by MaryÂ Wienhausen, Devotional image depicting a youthful Christ with MaryÂ Several paper-mÃ¢che images produced by the nuns of Wienhausen were also preserved, such as the image of the Man of Sorrows,Â Wienhausen, Man of Sorrows. Several images of the Veronica, the visage of Christ miraculously impressed on a cloth, were also discovered under the floorboards of the nuns' choir. An example of one such image isÂ Wienhausen, Veronica. The eyeglasses found at Wienhausen are some of the oldest ever discovered (early 14th century) and show that the earliest frames were made from wood. Small leather pouches, in which the glasses could be carried on a belt, were also discovered. According to Appuhn, all of the finds beneath the nuns' choir represent a conscious placement of items in a sacred spot. In the case of damaged eyeglasses, he surmises that they were deposited in the nuns' choir with the hope of preventing further damage to either the individual's eyes and/or soul (Die Brillen von Kloster Wienhausen und die Kunstgeschichte., 1079). In 1590 Provost Wilbrand of Oberg gave the convent its current main altar-piece, which depicts the life of Mary and Christ. The beams of the chapter house are also painted with depictions of vines and vegetation. The illuminated Responsorial from the convent depicts several scenes from the Easter storyÂ Wienhausen, Wienhausen Responsorial, particularly the image of the Arisen Christ and sleeping watchmen, which appears in other media in the convent as well. SeeÂ Wienhausen, Responsorial, detail of the Arisen ChristWienhausen, Wienhausen Responsorial, detail of the Arisen ChristÂ Among the images in this processional is one which depicts Ecclesia with female martyrs and another portraying Christ as a heavenly bridegroom surrounded by crowned virginsÂ Wienhausen Responsorial, detail Christ as the Heavenly BridegroomÂ (Uhde-Stahl, 47). Another small illumination portrays the coronation of the VirginÂ Wienhausen, Responsorial detail, coronation of Mary. The manuscripts' similarity to the imagery of the nuns' choir and the depiction of nuns in Cistercian habits indicates that this manuscript was produced in the convent (Uhde-Stahl, 48-49). According to Uhde-Stahl, the late date of the manuscript (after 1476) but the iconographically earlier images indicates that the manuscript may have been produced by older nuns who adhered to older artistic styles (Uhde-Stahl, 50). In addition, the seals of the abbess, provost, and convent are often preserved quite clearly on the convent's charters. SeeÂ Wienhausen, seal of the abbessWienhausen, seal of the provostWienhausen, seal of the convent ; The statue of the arisen Christ that stood on the altar of the nuns' choir was credited with performing miracles. According to the chronicle, a woman who had been granted refuge within the convent insulted the statue and was crippled on the spot. Only the nuns' prayers healed her. The convent continues as a noble women's chapter. The convent maintains a website atÂ wienhausen.de/html/kloster_fr.htm ; Little information exists about the literature available to the nuns in Wienhausen. The life of Duchess Agnes was written under the Abbess Margareta von SchÃ¶ningen (1302-1317). Abbess Katharina von Hoya provided three missals for the chapel of St. Anne circa 1433 and oversaw the compilation of the Wienhausen songbook. After the convent's reform in 1469 more references to literary works appear. The convent ofÂ MarienrodeÂ granted Wienhausen it Collectarium, a collection of the regulations of the Cistercian Order, so that the nuns could make their own copy. ; The Wienhausen Songbook was compiled under the abbecy of Katharina von Hoya. One illustrated processional, presumably made within the convent itself, is still extant and held at the convent (WNH). Of all the extant manuscripts, this one is the largest and most richly decorated. ; The Welf family were continual patrons of the community. The community was also supported by the neighboring nobles and patrician families of LÃ¼neburg and Braunschweig. The bishops of Hildesheim were active patrons of the community, surpassing even the gifts of the dukes of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg . In 1368 Duke Magnus ""the younger"" confirmed all of the convent's possessions within the protectorate of Celle would be free from the protectorate, services, petitions, and appraisals. In 1371 he decreed that neither he nor his successors could make monetary demands on the convent. ; The first ten nuns came from the convent ofÂ WÃ¶ltingerodeÂ under the Abbess Eveza, according to the chronicle. ; Most of the medieval convent survives at Wienhausen. The oldest portion of the convent is the All-Saints' chapel, built circa 1280. This chapel served as the burial place for abbesses and important patrons. The nuns' choir, built circa 1325, provides a unique glimpse into the religious life of medieval nuns. It remains in tact with its paintings and many other liturgical items from the Middle Ages. The convent also preserves several of the nuns' dowry chests from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries. SeeÂ Wienhausen, cloister complex ; The convent came into continual conflict with its provosts over the management and alienation of convent property. Circa 1410 the Provost Heinrich Hellewede von Verden resigned due to conflict with the abbess; twelve nuns removed his successor, Johannes Holthusen. A similar fate befell the Provost Dietrich Titze in 1478. The convent established several prayer-confraternities with other convents. In 1316 Abbess Margareta von SchÃ¶ningen formed a prayer confraternity with Abbot Hildebrand of the male Benedictine convent of S. Godehard in Hildesheim. In 1323 the convent joined a prayer confraternity with the female convent of Derneburg, and in 1324 they formed another with the Moritz-chapter in Hildesheim. Further bonds were created with the nunneries of Egeln in 1355 and Diestorf in 1522. In 1469 the convent undertook an internal reform with the help of the reformed convent of Derneburg. After undergoing reform, Wienhausen participated in the reform of the neighboring convent of Medingen. The convent's ties to both Derneburg and Medingen continued for hundreds of years (Leerhoff, 764). ; The community was closely tied to the Welf family. The dukes of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg had close ties to Wienhausen; female members of their families were educated and raised here, entered as nuns, or returned as widows. The dukes also served as protectors (Schutzherren) for the convent. Wienhausen has even been called the female house of the Welfs. In 1252 King Wilhelm of Holland, the step-son of Otto ""the child"" took Wienhausen into his protection. In 1267 the son of Otto ""the child"" was named as guardian of the convent (Leerhoff, 759). ; References to lay sisters emerge in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries lay brothers are mentioned. The convent had prebends to oversee the manual labor done on the convent's lands.";FAUX

The convent faced encroachments from the city of WÃ¼rzburg in 1297 after the taxes demanded from the convent by the city were rejected with reference to papal privileges. Hospital At the time of dissolution the convent's income was 390 Ducats yearly;"3807 ; Vallis sanctorum (1248) ; This Cistercian convent was founded by Jutta of Fuchsstadt, a sister of the knight Helebold (Hellenbold) of Fuchsstadt. According to Link, the property was originally held by Count Poppo of Henneberg, who gave it as a fief to the kinght Hellenbold. In 1233 the count released Hellenbold from his feudal ties and granted him the property as his own to found a house of 'grey sisters' (Link, 598). Jutta of Rustatt, sister of the knight, originally lived in EÃŸleben with a free community of pious women, who wished to organize themselves according to a definite rule. Bishop Hermann of WÃ¼rzburg gave them permission to found a new convent according to the Cistercian institutions in Bonenbach in January 1234 (Krausen, 48). She supposedly bestowed the name of Heiligenthal upon the convent and served as its first abbess. The bishop secured for himself the obedience of the convent's abbesses and the right to their benediction as well as spiritual and temporal jursidiction over the community. The convent was granted freedom from advocacy. No document records the formal incorporation of the community into the Cistercian order. ; In 1429/30 the abbots of Ebrach and Bronnbach received orders from the general chapter to reform Heiligenthal and command its income (Krausen, 49). Between 1463 and 1500 a provost and prior are named for Heiligenthal, but no abbess or convent. It is possible that the general chapter intended to transform the convent into a male community. In September 1501 Bishop Lorenz of Bibra summoned the abbess from Marburghausen to Heiligenthal and spoke of 40 years of abuses in the convent (Krausen, 49). Several nuns accompanied the abbess. Bishop Julius Echter transformed the possessions of the convent into the basis for his foundation of the ""Julius-hospital"" with papal approval. ; The convent supposedly held a chalice made of Abbess Jutta's arm and gold which cured the sick when the drank from it (Link, 598).

This established the foundation for the community's later property holdings (Stumpf, 228). A document from the twelfth century, falsely purporting to date to June 7, 990 and to the reign of Otto III, mentions other properties from the foundational period of the convent's history. From the earliest period the convent had possessions in Mittlingerode, FÃ¶rste, and in Osterode, Mackenrode, Gelliehausen, GÃ¶ttingen and Oldendorf near Einbeck. Besides the convent's holdings in land and pasture, it also developed the settlement of Nova Villa to the East (Stumpf, 229). The convent's possessions were increased through gifts of Emperor Otto II, who bestowed his properties from the old imperial holdings in Ambergau, north of Seesen. The previous imperial properties probably provided the foundation of the convent's landed property holdings (Stumpf, 223). The convent further acquired property in Derenburg, Utzleben and in Halberstadt, as indicated in a diploma from Heinrich II dated September 17, 1014. The convent also received gifts from the cathedral canonesses in the areas of Osterode and GÃ¶ttingen. To the east of the convent lay areas directly worked by the convent: the settlement of Nova Villa. According to Stumpf, the narrow range of the convent's property holdings and its close dependency on the imperial cathedral hindered an independent development of the convent (Stumpf, 223). The community controlled three estates or economic complexes: in the south, its possessions around Osterode; in the north, the possessions around Bornhausen/Seesen; and in the east, the possessions in Derenburg (Stumpf, 229). Holding of the convent were divided between the abbesses' holdings and conventual holdings (Stumpf, 235). The economic administration of the abbess's possessions was overseen by the abbatial steward, who from the thirteenth century belonged to the conversi of the convent (Stumpf, 235). ; The convent faced economic difficulties in the late fifteenth century due to a succession of abbesses with short-terms in office and the growth of the community. Building measures placed pressure on the financial strength of the community (Stumpf, 226). Duke Heinrich the Elder (1491-1514) intended to move the convent to Brunshausen and unite both communities and their goods. The conventual buildings were to be given to the Franciscans for a new foundation. In the face of the opposition of the abbess and the cathedral chapter the plan was never implemented (Stumpf, 226). In 1563 the convent held less than 30 hides (1 hide = 120 acres) of land; in 1482 records indicate that the convent controlled over 170 hides (Stumpf, 229). S. Marien was treated as a freehold and was burdened by the raising of taxes on the land. The convent was assessed a payment of 20 Gulden in 1448 and 15 Gulden in 1476 (Stumpf, 231). ; The convent had a school for both its novices and the education of girls, who were given to the convent specifically to be educated. A balance sheet from the sixteenth century records the sale of handwork, specificallly embroidery, weaving, and knitting, as a source of income (Stumpf, 234).";"15529 ; Gandesheim (939); monasterium S. Mariae Virginis vor Gandersheim (1076); ecclesia S. Mariae, domini et dominae (1229); Gandersem (1293); unser Vrowen closter (1331); Gandersemensis (1377) ; S. Marien was founded as a daughter house by a collaborative effort of the Abbess Wendelgard of the imperial chapter of canonesses atÂ GandersheimÂ and the bishop of Hildesheim. The foundation was consecrated by Bishop Thiethard of Hildesheim in 939. It is unclear whether the initial foundation observed the Benedictine rule or followed a more canonical form of observance. It may also have followed the rule established by Benedict of Aniane. Abbess Gerberga, the successor of Wendelgard, expanded the existing buildings of the convent and established a regular Benedictine observance in the convent for 30 nuns (Stumpf, 222). This expansion may be connected with a fire of 973 that destroyed the chapter-church in Gandersheim; after this the church of S. Marien may have served the canonesses as well as the nuns here. From 973 on S. Marien was apparently regarded as a regular Benedictine convent by the rulers and historians of the area(Stumpf, 233). However, Stumpf asserts that the community gradually developed into a chapter of canonesses; until the reform of 1482 the community was referred to frequently as ""secularis ecclesia"" or ""wertlikes stichte"" (Stumpf, 233). After 1482, however, reform movements reasserted a strict Benedictine observance in the community. Abbesses were elected by the community, confirmed by the imperial abbess at Gandersheim, and consecrated by the bishop of Hildesheim (Stumpf, 235). The abbess possessed her own property and had her own curia. ; Apparently the discipline of the convent began to grow more lax during the eleventh century. Unsatisfied with the conventual discipline, the nun Adelheid left the convent in 1076 for the community ofÂ Huysburg, in order to help with the foundation of this reformed convent and afterwards to live as an anchorite there (Stumpf, 223). In the first decades of the twelfth century, reform was introduced in the convent of Gandersheim. In 1118 a Saxon Reform Synod was held in the convent under the supervision of the papal legate Kuno von Praeneste. A document of Archbishop Heinrich I of Mainz dated to July 4, 1145 also indicates a return to the original Benedictine observance in the convent. However, in the thirteenth century the convent appears to have gravitated towards the freer constitutions of a chapter of canonesses. The abbey appears to have continually vascillated between a regular versus a canonical form of monasticism. In the late fifteenth century, an attempt was again made to reestablish strict Benedictine observance in the convent. The reform had to be agreed to by the imperial abbess. In July 1451 the imperial abbess hesitantly agreed to this reform, pressured by the papal legate and the bishop of Hildesheim and fearing the reduction of her proprietary-rights in the exempt convent. However, the abbess of S. Marien, Elisabeth von Ruscheplaten, opposed this and requested a letter of protection from the abbess of Hildesheim on February 6, 1452. She desired the same benefits as the imperial chapter held, i.e. the ability to participate in the imperial cathedral's development and exemption (Stumpf, 224). Duke Wilhelm the Elder of Braunschweig-WolfenbÃ¼ttel, acting as advocate, supported the attempt at Benedictine reform and promoted it. Abbess Elisabeth von Ruscheplaten then resigned from her abbecy (Stumpf, 224). Nevertheless, the planned reform of the convent never came to fruition due to the ensuing contest between two abbesses. In 1452, after the death of the cathedral abbess Elisabeth, two new abbesses were elected for the imperial chapter. The contest between the two abbesses, Countess Walburg von Spiegelberg and princess Sophie von Braunschweig-Grubenhagen lasted until 1468 and was the prime reason that a return to the Benedictine rule was not implemented in S. Marien. The canonesses left the convent, although the canons did not; at the same time, Elisabeth of Ruscheplaten remained in the position of abbess, despite her document of renunciation (Stumpf, 225). In the 1480s the reform to a strict Benedictine observance was finally achieved. The initiative in this reform came from the landed nobility. A document of Duke William the Younger from May 14, 1482 records that his relative, Abbess Sophia, with the consent of his father, Duke William the Elder, established the reform in the convent (Stumpf, 225). The Benedictine rule was thus once again strictly observed and established in the community. The convent was reformed along the guidelines of the Bursfeld Union. Those canonesses who did not wish to adhere to the strict Benedictine rule and wished to leave the community were given a pension (Stumpf, 225). At this time the convent was repopulated with Benedictine nuns from the convent ofÂ Lammspringe. The Duke of Braunschweig granted the reformed convent his protection and freed it from certain services to the city of Gandersheim. The two remaining canonesses received a monetary compensation, recorded on May 14, 1482. On October 22, 1542 the convent experienced its first Lutheran visitation, but the community showed little inclination to convert to the Lutheran teachings. A second visitation occurred in 1544. By 1568 the convent accepted the Lutheran reform, and the convent was dissolved in 1570. The dissolution of the convent was recorded in a document dated to October 9, 1570, which the abbess and all the nuns and lay-sisters signed (Stumpf, 228). In return the members of the community received pensions. The dissolution of the convent occurred without any previous understanding with the Abbess ofÂ Gandersheim. The convent also had a hospital (Stumpf, 242). ; HILPISH, Stephanus, 26. ; Landeshauptarchiv WolfenbÃ¼ttel. St. Gandersheim, n. 1-2; also WolfenbÃ¼ttel Archiv 3 and 4. Reg. imp. I 1550/51.

She expanded the existing buildings and established a regular Benedictine monasticism for 30 nuns in the abbey (Stumpf, 222). The abbesses of the community were: N. (June 7, 973); Reinburga (d. 1031); Ida (1031); Symodis (12th century); Udalhild (1145); Gisela (1227?-1229); Adelheid I (c. 1236; 1242-1257); Mechtild von Hohenbuechen (1263-1277); Berta I von Hardenberg (1280-1285); Sophia (1291-1305); Elisabeth I (1308-1312); Adelheid II (1312-1346); Gertrudis I (1350-1354); Berta II von der Soese (1372-1384); Gertrudis II von Grone (1400-1429); Elisabeth II von Rusheplaten (1429-1461); Adelheid III von Bothmer (1463-1477); Margarete von Ruscheplaten (1482-1484); Gertrud von Bortfeld; Elisabeth Leyneman (1485-1486); Margarete Dernedden (1486-1509). From 1476-1486 the abbesses were nuns fromÂ Lammspringe. ; Benedictine (see foundation field/ contributor's notes) ; The convent was composed of women from the lower nobility and from the bourgeoisie. The eight nuns mentioned in 1274 all came from the lower aristocracy, among them the families of the curia, from Gandersheim, Gladebeck, Hardenberg, Hattorf, Sehlde, and Woltorf (Stumpf, 234). ; Abbess Gerberga II established a regular Benedictine convent for 30 nuns. Around the middle of the twelfth century the number of inhabitants shrank from 30 to 20 (Stumpf, 233). A document of the imperial chapter of Gandersheim from May 31, 1274 records 8 names of nuns in the community of S. Marien. In the early fifteenth century besides the abbess and sexton there were listed only two or three nuns. According to Stumpf, the decline in numbers was due to the movement of the community to a more canonical form of observance (Stumpf, 233). In 1544 and 1546 there were eleven nuns, seven lay-sisters. In 1570 at the time of dissolution the convent held 10 inhabitants including the prioress (Stumpf, 234). ; Gandersheim; The convent lay in the duchy of Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel. ; On October 22, 1542 the convent experienced its first Lutheran visitation. ; The conventual buildings were first erected in the Ottonian period. The conventual buildings lay to the east of the city, outside the city wall, southeast from the chapter of canons in Gandersheim, according to a Diploma of Otto II circa 973. The founding buildings were erected in the abbecy of the founding abbess, Wendelgard (933-949), and were completed with the aid of Bishop Thiethard of Hildesheim (Stumpf, 222). A new church in the Gothic style replaced the older Ottonian building in 1274. The church was divided between the men's choir in the east and the nuns' choir in the west (Stumpf, 241). The nuns' choir was in the upper story, as in many other German convents. The dormitory was located to the west of the Church. A porter's house and houses for the priests were located on the north side of the conventual enclosure. In the east were the gardens (Stumpf, 242). In the late fifteenth century the convent erected a new refectory and dormitory. After the dissolution of the convent in 1570, its land and buildings went to the ""Paedagogium illustre"" in Gandersheim, which was erected as a preliminary stage to a university there. The convent's goods later fell to the University of Helmstedt. ; An undated description from the sixteenth century refers to crosses and chalices as well as a statue of the Virgin with a crown and scepter made of silver and an Agnus Dei of gold among the treasures of the convent (Stumpf, 242). A seal of the convent from the twelfth century exists, which depicts the Virgin Mary seated with a large nimbus and without child. In her left hand she holds a scepter of lilies and in her right a globe with a cross. The legend reads: Sancta Maria A Virgo In Gandersheim (Stumpf, 247). Several seals of individual abbesses also exist. ; The house may have vacillated between strict Benedictine adherence and the more relaxed model of canonesses. Throughout its history, the convent retained close ties with the imperial chapter of canonesses and canons atÂ Gandersheim. The convent built a new organ between 1504 and 1510. ; Nothing is known about the monastic library of this community in its early period. In 1477 the convent established a new library, and the records show 45 book titles, most of which were dictionaries, commentaries, and handbooks (Stumpf, 240). ; A psalter, dating to 1503, and a Liber precum, dating from 1452 and owned by Margareta Ruscheplaten (a member of the community?) are the only remaining literary works from the community. (see manuscript sources) ; Abbess Gerberga II provided the initial endownment for the community. Emperor Otto II also acted as a benefactor. ; From the time of its foundation as an abbey under imperial protection until its dissolution, the convent belonged to the proprietary convents of the cathedral chapter ofÂ Gandersheim, and this status as a convent under its patronage remained unaltered (Stumpf, 222-223). The chapter was required to provide the new foundation with help and protection. Throughout its history, S. Marien retained a strong dependence on the imperial chapter atÂ Gandersheim. The abbess of the imperial chapter held the right of confirmation of the election of abbesses of the convent (Stumpf, 230). Canons of Gandersheim performed the majority of spiritual functions for the convent from the fourteenth century onwards. Joint processions with the canonesses ofÂ GandersheimÂ are also recorded in the ""Registrum chori"" of the convent. The two communities also had ties of spiritual confraternity between their members (Stumpf, 230). ; Only a few architectural ruins remain of the convent. ; The influence of the bishops of Hildesheim were important in the community since its foundation. The convent also had connections to the Bursfeld Congregation, although it never officially joined the congregation and observed only aspects of the Bursfel observence (Stumpf, 231). The abbess of the convent held rights of patronage over the following churches: Mitlingerode in Osterode, in DÃ¼derode in Osterode, in Lewe (Levede), in Utzleben, Sebexen in Osterode, and in SÃ¶se in Osterode. In 1145 under Abbess Udalhild a chapel was errected in Sebexen in the district of Osterode, over which she acquired full rights of patronage in 1352. In SÃ¶se the abbes Bertradis held the right of patronage over the chapel of S. Mauritius until 1375. The churches in Derenburg and the village of BÃ¶hnhausen, which were a gift of the imperial Abbess Sophia I from the property of the chapter ofÂ GandersheimÂ weere confirmed by King Heinrich II. Priests from S. Marien oversaw the liturgical duties in these churches (Stumpf, 240). ; The convent also had to defend itself against the claims of the rulers of Braunschweig. In 1531 Maria, a princess of Braunschweig, was elected abbess. The convent was affected by the measures of several 'interest groups,' including the bishops of Hildesheim, papal legates, the local dukes, and the abbess of the imperial chapter (Gandersheim). Since the tenth century, the advocacy for the convent was assumed by the advocate of the imperial chapter ofÂ Gandersheim. In 1134 Count Siegfried IV of Boyneburg served as the head-advocate of the imperial chapter and its proprietary convents. On May 3, 1259 the imperial abbess Margaret acquired the right of advocacy over the chapter from the counts of Wohldenberg. The Welf family acquired the right of advocacy over the chapter and its proprietary holdings with Duke Albrecht I of Braunschweig-Lueneburg. From the fifteenth century, the dukes attempted to extend their influence over the convent on the basis of their protection and involvement in the reform movements. Thus by 1482 the reform of the convent could only occur with the permission of the duke (Stumpf, 231). In 1570 the duke dissolved the convent without giving any thought to the rights of the imperial chapter. ; An undated document on pergament from circa 1300 lists the possessions of property belonging to the convent in Echte and Sebexen (Stumpf, 229). A diploma of Otto II, dated to June 7, 973, concerning the first foundation of the convent from 939 records that nuns lived here, who followed the Benedictine rule as established by the Abbess Gerberga II in 973 (Stumpf, 232). ; Canons fromÂ GandersheimÂ were responsible for the priestly duties at the convent. The convent also had its own priests for different altars. The first documented priest was Albertus (1265). The convent also had vicars.";FAUX

These record gifts made to the community by the king and record that the community was placed under his protection. Another document records a gift of Oda, in which she grants the convent possession of her properties which she had previously loaned to King Ludwig (Heineken, 18). Counts Brun and Otto, sons of the founder, transferred the convent into the king's power; before this time they oversaw the property of the convent, although Count Liudolf had personally conferred property upon the church of Gandersheim (Heineken, 52). According to this document then, the property of Gandersheim was not alienated from the family holdings until the count's sons transferred the convent to the king's possession. On the one hand, the king protected the property of the canonesses which lay within his holdings; on the other hand, he retained control over the administration of the property over those who held its usufruct (Heineken, 53). The character of their community thus appears to have been controlled by members of the imperial family. Ludwig III bestowed a gift upon Gandersheim, and his wife, Liutgarde, maintained a close relationship with the convent (Heineken, 61). ; According to Heineken, Gandersheim was a very rich community (29). The widespread landholdings of the community enabled the abbess, when she travelled to Rome, to spend every night at one of the convent's own properties (or dependencies?) (29). According to the Saxon Annals (Annalista Saxo), Gandersheim retained only its richest properties, because Heinrich I disputed with his brothers over the property (Heineken, 51).";"6707 ; Imperial chapter (Reichsstift) ; The Annals of the conventÂ QuedlinburgÂ record the foundation of the church of Gandersheim in ""antiquiori loco"" (Heineken, 30). According to Heineken, the earliest documents refer to the pre-existing church and do not record the actual establishment of the community. In these documents Luidolf granted possessions to the church of Gandersheim as well as relics, whose authenticity were confirmed by the Pope Sergius. There is no date for this document, although it likely originates in the thirteenth century and may be based on an earlier document. An older papal document also records Pope Sergius' donation of relics to the Count Luidolf (Heineken, 8-9). According to the references, the relic consisted of a drop (or drops) of the Blood of Christ. According to the documents, Luidolf made his gifts to the community at the consecration of his daughter. The community was composed of female canonesses. The original community was presumably founded circa 852 in Brunshausen; after 856 it was transfered to Gandersheim. According to Hrotsvit, the church and relics were dedicated in 881. Heineken regards the Saxon Count Liudolf as the founder; he granted the church of Gandersheim and the three canonesses there property from his hereditary lands (28). Otto I confirmed this grant in 956. Further gifts to the community were made by Ludwig III and Oda or King Arnulf. Oda participated in the foundation as well and later dwelled in the convent. The foundation was intended for the salvation of Count Liudolf's soul. This was an imperial chapter of canonesses. ; At Gandersheim the exercise of jurisdiction never lay in the hands of the abbess. Provosts held jurisdictional authority (Heineken, 55); although, the abbess of Gandersheim was granted the right to participate in the administration of justice (Heineken, 56). Luidolf's wife, Oda, built the nunnery ofÂ Brunshausen, dedicated to S. Stephanus, which became a dependency of Gandersheim. In July 1451 the imperial abbess hesitantly agreed to a reform movement inÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's), pressured by the papal legate and the bishop of Hildesheim and fearing the reduction of her proprietary-rights in the exempt convent. However, the abbess ofÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's), Elisabeth von Ruscheplaten, opposed this and requested a letter of protection from the abbess of Hildesheim on February 6, 1452. In 1452, after the death of the cathedral abbess Elisabeth, two new abbesses were elected for the imperial chapter. The contest between the two abbesses, Countess Walburg von Spiegelberg and princess Sophie von Braunschweig-Grubenhagen lasted until 1468. There is a modern bronze statue of Hrostvitha giving Otto I her history near the church of Gandersheim. The Abbey is now used as a Lutheran church. The town of Bad Gandersheim can be found atÂ bad-gandersheim.de ; Gandersheim had a relic of the Holy Blood, given to the community by Luidolf and authenticated by Pope Sergius. According to Heineken, Luidolf brought a rich treasury of relics from Rome to the community (30).

Agius records five sisters and Oda living there. Two of the sisters later married, two others followed the first as abbesses (Heineken, 31). According to Hrosvit, however, all the sisters were consecrated to God.

(see manuscript sources) ; The community was an imperial chapter and enjoyed the patronage of King Ludwig II and his wife, Liutgarde. Count Liudolf and his wife, Oda, were also patrons of the community. According to Bodo, ""filiam principis abbatissam habent, futurum est ut patrem patiantur abbatem"" (Heineken, 127). The imperial house acted as a patron of the community (e.g.Â [Letter to Gerberga, abbess of Gandersheim, 968]). ; Luidolf and Oda's daughter joined the community. ; In 1134 Count Siegfried IV of Boyneburg served as the head-advocate of the imperial chapter and its proprietary convents.

The Welf family acquired the right of advocacy over the chapter and its proprietary holdings with Duke Albrecht I of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg (Stumpf, 231). ; The oldest verifiable documents for the history of Gandersheim are two documents of Ludwig III. These record gifts made to the community by the king and record that the community was placed under his protection. There are two literary references to the nunnery in the works of Agius. In one Agius records a dialogue with the sisters of Gandersheim when he was in the community upon the death of Hathmut (Heineken, 18-19). The sources for Gandersheim are richer for the second half of the tenth century. Gandersheim Abbey (Frauenstift / Reichsstift Gandersheim)  
Secular canonesses’ house on the upper Gande River, today Bad Gandersheim, Lower Saxony

1. Foundation and Legal Status  
• 852 – Liudolf, duke of the Saxons, and his wife Oda transferred the relics of the martyrs Anastasius and Innocentius to a new women’s chapter first settled at Brunshausen; in 856 the community moved 2 km upstream to “Gandersheim”.  
• From the start it was a Reichsstift: directly subject to the king/emperor, free from diocesan control, with broad judicial and fiscal privileges.  
• Headed by a princess-abbess (Fürstäbtissin) who, from 1209, held a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet.  
• Inmates were secular canonesses (canonissae / Damen), not cloistered nuns: they sang the Office but made no perpetual vows of poverty or enclosure and kept personal property.

2. Composition of the Chapter  
• Admission required high birth; by the 12th c. applicants had to prove 16 noble quarterings.  
• Size: c. 30–40 prebends before 1200; 20–25 in late Middle Ages.  
• Each canoness occupied her own house (Klausurhaus) within the abbey precinct, maintained servants, horses and sometimes her own chaplain.

3. Ecclesiastical & Liturgical Activity  
• Daily Divine Office and conventual Mass in the collegiate church of SS Anastasius & Innocentius (three-aisled basilica, 10th-12th c.).  
• Annual memorial for the Liudolfing founders on 11 November; great processions on the feast of St Anastasius (27 April).  
• The abbey possessed an important music school; by c. 1000 it owned one of the earliest known organetto-style organs in Saxony.

4. Cultural Achievements  
• Scriptoria and library flourished under Abbess Gerberga II (949-1001):  
 – Hroswitha (Latin Roswitha) of Gandersheim, first known female dramatist of the West, composed six Latin “comedies”, legend cycles and a world chronicle c. 960-970.  
 – Gesta abbatum Gandeshemensium (11th-c.) and other house chronicles produced here.  
• 12th-15th c.: illumination of sequentiaries, antiphoners and a magnificent jewelled gospel cover (now in Göttingen).  
• Schola puellarum educated noble girls in Latin grammar, chant, arithmetic and courtly French.

5. Territorial Lordship & Politics  
• The abbess ruled a small principality of c. 80 villages, woods, mills and silver mines (Rammelsberg lease).  
• Maintained her own mint (bracteates “Gandersheimer Pfennige”), market and toll rights; issued charters under the double-headed abbey seal.  
• Frequent jurisdictional conflicts with the Bishops of Hildesheim and the Welf dukes of Brunswick (the “Gandersheimer Streit”, 1130-1215).  
• Abbess Sophia (1002-1039), daughter of Emperor Otto II, mediated imperial elections and acted as foster-mother for cousin Henry III.

6. Economic Life  
• Endowment: large estate block between Leine and Harz, vineyards near Helmstedt, wool from heath flocks, tithes from 40+ parishes.  
• Each prebend paid its canoness c. 25 Malter (≈1 tonne) of grain, 4 hogsheads of wine and numerous money rents.  
• From c. 1300 most demesne land was leased for cash, turning the chapter into a regional creditor; surviving rent-rolls (Zinsregister) list over 800 tenants.  
• A hospital farm (Siechenhof) and a fish-pond grange at Clus were worked by conversi and lay brothers until the 14th c.

7. Charity, Hospitality, Pastoral Outreach  
• Maintained St Georg Hospital outside the western gate (12 beds, priest-rector, two lay sisters).  
• Weekly “poor dole”: bread, pea-soup, and on Maundy Thursday washing the feet of 13 widows with a coin gift.  
• Supplied chaplains to dependent parishes; canonical visitations assured liturgical standards in surrounding villages.

8. Military & Defensive Duties  
• Though themselves non-combatants, abbesses owed a contingent of 40 armed men to the emperor; usually commuted to scutage (shield-money).  
• Built and maintained the town wall (first stone circuit c. 1200); a garrison quartered in the abbey bailey guarded silver transports from the Harz-mines.

9. Social & Recreational Life  
• Diet: meat allowed outside fasts; wine from abbey vineyards; strict rules against “excessive spiced cakes” (1332 statute).  
• Falconry and riding permitted in abbey forests; dice-play restricted to 4 pfennigs a stake.  
• Canonesses could—and often did—withdraw to marry; exit fees (Gnadengeld) repaid from prebend income.

10. Late Medieval & Early-Modern Fate  
• 14th-15th c.: modest decline in numbers but steady income; Romanesque church retrofitted with Gothic choir (1400-50).  
• Reformation: 1542 duke Heinrich the Younger imposed Lutheran visitation; by 1568 the chapter was officially Protestant yet retained imperial immediacy.  
• 17th-18th c.: abbesses were Welf princesses; abbey remained a tiny sovereign state until Napoleonic secularisation in 1802/03, then annexed to Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and dissolved 1810.  
• The collegiate church (now Stiftskirche) and much of the precinct survive; Hroswitha’s literary legacy keeps Gandersheim prominent in medieval cultural studies.

Summary  
Throughout the Middle Ages Gandersheim’s secular canonesses combined a full liturgical life with wide-ranging secular authority. They governed a principality, managed lucrative estates and mines, educated noble women, engaged in high-level imperial politics, dispensed charity, and—above all—became a beacon of Ottonian and Romanesque art and letters through the works of Hroswitha and the abbey’s scriptorium.";FAUX

This core holding comprised the village of Lamspringe (RÃ¶mer, 366). The main complex of possessions of the convent were located in the area between the Heber, Hohe Dehne and Harplage (RÃ¶mer, 355). The convent possessed 15 hides in 1149 and 1178, which were worked directly by the convent itself (RÃ¶mer, 356). The chapter of Hildesheim confirmed the bestowal of property which lay in the area of Hildesheim to the convent of Lammspringe and ceded the tithes to the convent as well (Heinken, 32). Earlier gifts from Duke Henry the Lion and Count Albrecht of Brandenburg in Banteln were confirmed in 1182 by the bishop of Minden (RÃ¶mer, 335). The convent held 1/2 hide in Banteln, a hide in Bikem bei Gronau in 1178, 4 hides in Quickborn bei Eldagsen, 1 hide in Sickeroth, and 8 1/2 hides in Herebergen bei Schulenburg. The convent possessed 3 and 1/2 hides in Gestorp in 1178 and portions of the church in Apelern, mentioned in a grant of Duke Henry ""the lion"" and Margrave Albrecht ""the bear"" (RÃ¶mer, 360). In the thirteenth century the convent acquired several hides of land and farms in Ilde and Moteshausen in 1264 (in GroÃŸ Ilde it had 9 hides in 1149/1178 and in Klein Ilde it held 14 in the same years), in WÃ¶llersheim (7 hides in 1149; 10 in 1178), in Holthusen (6 hides in 1149 and 1178), in Liermunde in 1272, 1274, in Ammenhusen in 1291, and in Brodesende 1283 (RÃ¶mer, 337). The episcopacy of Hildesheim stood behind much of Lammspringe's economic expansion in the thirteenth century. By the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries the convent's control of land in Lammspringe, Neuhof and WÃ¶llersheim was complete, only the area of Ammenhausen remained outside the control of the convent (RÃ¶mer, 356). During the thirteenth century, the convent also acquired tithes from several areas: from Rolfshagen and Hieshausen in 1285, in GroÃŸ RhÃ¼den in 1289, in Mahlum (5 hides and tithes from the entire area) in 1285 and 1295, and tithes in Hildeveshausen in 1296, Evensen (10-15 hides in 1149 and 1178)(RÃ¶mer, 337). In Wohlenhausen the convent acquired 20 hides by 1198. The convent also held possessions within the parish of Woltwiesche and in its surrounding areas, which were presumably quite ancient holdings (RÃ¶mer, 361). The convent acquired tithes and patronage rights in 1285 and 1296 in Stoery and in the church of S. Adrian. In KÃ¶nigsdahlum the convent held 37 hides in 1302 (RÃ¶mer, 361). The convent also held scattered possessions to the northwest in Gronau, Eldagsen, Springe as well as in Woltwiesche and Lafferde (RÃ¶mer, 358). By circa 1330 the period of expansion of Lammspringe's territories was complete. In the fourteenth century, there were fewer donations of money and goods and a rise in payments for the support of the nuns in connection with donations for masses and memorials (RÃ¶mer, 338-9). ; The convent was wealthy during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, so much so that it was able to accumulate surplus wealth through the purchase of properties, such as four saltpans in Salzdetfurth in 1194, confirmed by Bishop Harbert in 1214, and six hides and 12 meadows in Honstedt in 1213 (RÃ¶mer, 335). In 1178 Bishop Adelog of Hildesheim confirmed the possessions of the convent and took the community into his protection. At that time, the possessions of Lammspringe numbered 278 hides (1 hide = 120 acres), 10 mills, tithes from 17 places, and proprietary rights in 4 parish churches (RÃ¶mer, 335). In addition, the convent began to acquire legal and political rights in the areas where it held property. Count Ludger ""von Werder"" declared in 1225 that the properties of Lammspringe within his county were free, i.e. he could not levy taxes and held no right to criminal courts/or scaffolds in those areas (RÃ¶mer, 336). In 1362 and 1368 two documents refer to the poverty of the convent. In 1370 some of the convent's goods were mortgaged in order to provided bread and beer for the nuns (RÃ¶mer, 340). The convent apparently faced economic difficulty in the fifteenth, as the sale of certain tithes and the relinquishment of outlying farms indicate (RÃ¶mer, 367). In 1404 eight hides of land in Neuhof and in 1406 possessions in Banteln were transferred to the chapter of the Holy Cross in Hildesheim (RÃ¶mer, 340). In 1405 the convent complained to the German king about its difficulty in providing for its nuns and members of the community due to the alienation of several villages, possessions, and tithes. It also complained that several of the cloister's buildings were old and in ruins (RÃ¶mer, 340). From 1480 on, the convent's finances improved again. In 1518 the convent re-acquired its alienated property in Neuhof (RÃ¶mer, 367). ; The convent exercised jurisdictional rights only in the villages of Lammspringe, Neuhof (Liermunde), WÃ¶llersheim, and Wohlenhausen. The convent's jurisdiction incompased laws ""commanding or forbidding"" action but not the right of criminal trials(RÃ¶mer, 364). From its first foundation, the convent also held proprietary rights over the smaller churches within its immediate district (RÃ¶mer, 368). A chapel in Neuhof is designated the ""filia"" of the conventual church in 1312, and the parish churches of Graste and GroÃŸ Ilde, north of Lammspringe, were confirmed as part of the convent's domain in 1178 (RÃ¶mer, 368). In 1331 the convent incorporated the chapel in Rolfshagen. Lammspringe acquired patronage over the churches in StÃ¶ry in 1296 and BÃ¶nnien in 1308. The convent exercised patronage rights over the church of S. Adrian in Woltwiesche presumably since its foundation; this was confirmed in 1149, 1178, 1542, and 1568 (RÃ¶mer, 369). ; The church in BÃ¶nnien was incorporated into the convent in 1308 (RÃ¶mer, 337). In 1331 the convent incorporated the chapel in Rolfshagen.";"15404 ; Lamspringe; sanctus Adrianus monasterium (873); ecclesia sancti Adriani lamesprinche (1149); ecclesia in Lamesprigge (1169); monasterium beatorum Adriani et Dyonisii martirum in Lammespringhe (1338) ; From the mid-ninth century until circa 1220 a chapter of canonesses existed at Lammspringe, afterwards a Benedictine convent until 1538/71. From 1571-1643 the convent functioned as an evangelical women's chapter (RÃ¶mer, 331). Lammspringe was founded by a married couple, Count Ricdag and Emhild (Imhild) who provided the property for the foundation and established their daughter, Ricburg, as the first abbess (Heineken, 31). According to the foundation legend, the couple, desiring a son, made a pilgrimage to Rome where Pope Sergius II gave them relics of S. Hadrian, one of the patrons of the convent established at Lammspringe. Bishop Altfried of Hildesheim called the foundation ""the church of S. Hadrian"" and granted some tithes in Lammspringe for land near Hildesheim in November 872 as well as guaranteed the convent the right to freely elect its abbesses (RÃ¶mer, 332). In the twelfth century the convent underwent an internal reform and switched from a community of canonesses living under the Augustinian rule to a Benedictine convent adhering to the rule of S. Benedict (Strumpf, 101). Bishop Berthold of Hildesheim imposed the Benedictine rule upon the community as part of the general reform movement of the period. A letter of protection from Pope Innocent II from 1138 mentions the establishment of the Benedictine rule in the community through the bishop. It also mentions strict claustration for the convent (RÃ¶mer, 349). This letter also allowed the convent to elect its own ""provisor"" (overseer) to oversee the convent's temporal and spiritual concerns (RÃ¶mer, 333). The provisor was not identical with the provost. Nuns from this community may have formed the new Benedictine convent ofÂ Brunshausen. The convent has belonged to the diocese of Hildesheim since 815! ; Secondary patrons of the community, which had altars in the convent were: Katharine (1259, 1261, 1399, 1487); Lebuinus (1471); John the Apostle and John the Evangelist (1483, 1499); Peter (1513); all apostles (1516). In the fifteenth century the convent joined the reform movement and underwent an internal reform that emphasized stricter religiosity and a more communal lifestyle. The reform in Lammspringe sprang from close ties toÂ GandersheimÂ during this period (RÃ¶mer, 341). In 1455 Mechthild Wolpke, a nun at Lammspringe, who had served as Prioress in the reformedÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's)Â , renounced her profession (RÃ¶mer, 341). In the fifteenth century several altars were erected or renewed in the convent: an altar to Mary in 1446, one to S. Levinus in 1471, one to S. John the Evangelist and S. John the Baptist in 1483, one to S. Katharine in 1513, and one to all apostles in 1516. None of these foundations were made by the laity but rather by priests from Lammspringe, Gandersheim and Holy Cross in Hildesheim (RÃ¶mer, 342). The convent became involved in the Hildesheim feud between the dukes of Calenberg and and the dukes of Braunschweig-WolfenbÃ¼ttel . In 1522 the convent was burnt to the ground (RÃ¶mer, 342). The convent was not yet dissolved but suffered in subsequent years from economic hardships and high taxes. Beginning in 1542 officials tried to impose Lutheranism in the convent, but reports of the reformers display that the nuns did not observe the new teachings (RÃ¶mer, 343, 351). In 1569 the convent became a Lutheran women's chapter. The convent undertook the education of girls. In 1643 the convent ceased to be female. The community was transferred to a group of English Benedictine monks, who resided in Lammspringe from 1643-1803 (RÃ¶mer, 348). ; The documents indicate that the convent held either relics or perhaps the entire corpse of S. Hadrian (Heineken, 31). ; link to Riddagshausen near Braunschweig & Belgian community of S.

Known prioresses of the Benedictine convent are: Jutta (c. 1178-1205); Beatrix (1253, 1265); Adelheid (1267); Elisabeth (1300-1302); Adelheid (1307-1314); Margarete (1324); Johanna (1325-1336); Elisabeth Trobe (1351-1362); Mechthild (1364-1365); Margarete (1368-1370); Fredeke (1373); Ermendrut (1382); Frederint v.

Besides the convent complex, Lammspringe also had ""external farms"" in Neuhof, WÃ¶llersheim, Hieshausen (1325), Wohlenhausen (1237, 1362), Ilde (1362) and presumably in Redingehausen, Ammenhausen, and Rolfshagen (RÃ¶mer, 367). The outlying farms were managed by ""brothers."" The convent held the rights of patronage over the church in Graste, which were confirmed in 1305, and in the chapel in StÃ¶ry. The conven'ts patronage in Ilde and Graste, where the convent held few proprietary rights, may have stemmed from a grant of the chapter at Hildesheim (RÃ¶mer, 366). The church in BÃ¶nnien (S. Adrian) was incorporated into the convent in 1308 (RÃ¶mer, 337). The convent also received income from numerous tithes. In 1149 Bishop Bernhard enumerated the areas in which Lammspringe retained tithes from its predecessor (canonesses). These areas were: Lamesprinche, Neuhof/Liermunde, Holthusen, Waldersheim, Getteroth, Sehlem, Evensen, Klein Ilde, GroÃŸ Ilde, Bruneshusen, Modeshusen, Pithele, Eilberneshusen, Redingheshusen (south of Lammspringe), Ekehardeshusen (west of Lammspringe) and Banteln (RÃ¶mer, 362). In 1178 Bishop Adelog confirmed the convent's right to these tithes. In 1178 then the convent received tithes from 11 places and partial tithes in 6 other places (RÃ¶mer, 362). A large portion of these tithes came from a few hides, which later went wild. The tithes stemmed primarily from grants made circa 1149 and 1178. In 1285 the convent acquired new tithes in BÃ¶nnien (RÃ¶mer, 363). Another group of tithes of the convent was formed in the thirteenth century around the villages of GroÃŸ RhÃ¼den, Mechtshausen and Rolfshagen (RÃ¶mer, 363). Tithes consisted of portions of grain and meat. In the fourteenth century, families who gave their daughters to the convent no longer created funds for memorials but more often provided them with dowries (RÃ¶mer, 339). From 1450-1460 the convent received several bequests. Eight bequests are apparent for the nuns and ten for the lay-sisters from 1446-1515 (RÃ¶mer, 342). In 1478 Ekbert Bex gave the convent a document ensuring it an income of 30 Marks upon the entrance of his daughter, Dorothea; Margarete Kramer from Hildesheim was provided for in the convent in 1488 with almost 160 pounds (RÃ¶mer, 351). The convent held proprietary rights in the church in Graste (RÃ¶mer, 359). ; Augustinian; Benedictine by 1138 ; In the twelfth century the convent was composed primarily of women from the nobility (RÃ¶mer, 349). A daughter of Margrave Albrecht ""the bear"" was a nun in 1162; a daughter of Countess Eufemia of Thinkleve was a nun of the community in 1183, and a daughter of Conrad and Richenza von Westerhove was a nun in 1190, among others (RÃ¶mer, 349). Prioresses generally came from the local nobility. In the mid-fifteenth century prioresses appear with bourgeois names: Margarete Gerleves (1450), Gese (1450-51), Gertrud (1464), Mechthild Witten (1466), Richeidis Wiesen (1474-1492), and Mechthild (Mette) Koch (1493-1528). ; Circa 1405 the convent had 180 nuns as well as servants and a hospital. A visitation report from circa 1568 lists only nineteen nuns and five lay-sisters. ; In the administrative district of Hildesheim. ; In the ninth century the convent was located in the territorial holdings of the clan of Ricdag. From the ninth century on, it belonged to Hildesheim. This community was located half way between the convents of Gandersheim and Hildesheim. ; Medieval documents refer to a nuns' choir, perhaps in the upper story of the church. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there was a rise in the number of altars established in the church, although the exact location of several of them is uncertain (RÃ¶mer, 371). During the fifteenth century the church of Lammspringe was renovated in the Gothic style. Isolated references appear to a kitchen, the provost's house, and a hospital (RÃ¶mer, 372). ; Many of the convent's material goods and artworks were taken from the convent in the wake of the Protestant reformation. Only a clock and one picture from the late fifteenth century remain in the convent. The seal of the convent from circa 1250 depicts S. Hadrian (Adrian) with a long cloak, holding in his left hand a palm branch and in his right, a sword. The inscription reads ""SCS Adrianus Martir in Lammessprigge"" (S. Adrian, marytr in Lammspringe) (RÃ¶mer, 376). ; The foundation of this community is recorded in a forged document; in a document from Ludwig the German, which exists in a later copy; and in a transcript of Bishop Adelog from the year 1187 (Heineken, 32). Besides the prioress, the records mention the offices of cantoress, sacristan, chamberlain, cellerar, and financial/economic head (RÃ¶mer, 350). ; A book from the convent (preserved in the Herzog-August-Bibliothek) mentions the nun Ermengarde (c. 1178/1205) as the scribe and as the painter of a miniature of S. Augustine. It is thus likely that the convent did possess a scriptorium (RÃ¶mer, 370). There are 18 extant books from the convent, 12 stem from the twelfth century. Of the twelve, there are four works of Augustine, two of Gregory the Great, two from Venerable Bede, and one each by Hieronymus, Clemens, John Chrysostomos, and Hugo of S. Victor. RÃ¶mer ascribes these works to the influence of provost Gerhard (1178-1205) (RÃ¶mer, 335). ; The convent received the patronage of the local nobility. In 1365 the family of Wallmoden founded an altar in the convent, and in 1335-1336 the family of Steinberg provided funds for the celebration of an anniversary (RÃ¶mer, 339). The two prioresses from the house of Steinberg, Frederint (1383-1385) and Elisabeth (1390-1391) brought with them numerous foundations in 1373, 1383, 1384, and 1385. These gifts were united into a chapel. ; According to one document, the community was subordinate to Hildesheim, although it claimed freedom according to its own rights under the protection of the king. Such claims probably never materialized (Heineken, 32). ; Count Ricdag's daughter, Ricburg, was placed as the first abbess when the community was a chapter of canonesses. The daughter of Margrave Albrecht ""the Bear"" was buried in the community, although it is unclear whether she was a canoness or a nun (RÃ¶mer, 334). ; None of the medieval structures remain. ; The two convents maintained close ties: in 1217 Provost Werenbert fromÂ BrunshausenÂ appears in a document of Bishop Siegfried of Hildesheim for the convent of Lammspringe and in the seventeenth century nuns from Lammspringe are mentioned in documents for Brunshausen (Strumpf, 101). In 1253 the convent sold a hide in Lebenstedt to the convent of Riddagshausen near Braunschweig and in 1383 another in Lobmachtersen toÂ Neuwerk. The provosts of the convent were also archdeacons of the diocese of Hildesheim for the administrative district of the convent since the twelfth century (RÃ¶mer, 335). The office of provost was a grant (fief) of the bishop of Hildesheim, and the chapter of Hildesheim retained many of the rights and privileges of the provost for itself (RÃ¶mer, 364). In 1312 provost John and prioress Alheidis formed a prayer confraternity with the convent of Grammont in Belgium, which was also dedicated to S. Adrian (RÃ¶mer, 350). Two of the prioresses ofÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's)Â came from Lammspringe: Margarete Darnedden (1486-1509) and Mechthild Wolpke (1484). RÃ¶mer assumes that the close times toÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's)Â andÂ BrunshausenÂ and their reforms affected the reform of Lammspringe in the fifteenth century; however, supporting documentation of such a connection is lacking (RÃ¶mer, 350). In 1482 when the reform ofÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's)Â was completed, nuns, novices, and students moved from Lammspringe toÂ S. Marien (S. Mary's)Â (RÃ¶mer, 351). ; On June 13, 873 King Louis the German took Lammspringe into his special protection (RÃ¶mer, 332). During the years of political territorial-building by the local nobility, the convent sought to assert and strengthen its autonomy (RÃ¶mer, 336). The provosts of Lammspringe in conjunction with the bishops of Hildesheim annexed numerous properties from the local nobility in Ambergau and thus withdrew the legal and political influence of the Counts of Wohldenberg and the overlordship of the Welf-ruled foundation ofÂ GandersheimÂ over the convent (RÃ¶mer, 336). The economic expansion of the convent during the thirteenth century had the political motive of placing Lammspringe in the position of the chapter of Gandersheim and hindering the ability of Gandersheim to exercise its privileges of overlordship through the Welf dukes (RÃ¶mer, 338). The convent's rights of patronage and tithes eventually streched into the Welf dukes' area of influence, especially the tithe in Mahlum (RÃ¶mer, 366). The dukes of Braunschweig granted letters of protection to the convent under Duke Heinrich and Duke Albrecht in 1289 (RÃ¶mer, 338). In 1405 King Ruprecht promised the convent exemption from imperial taxes, tolls, and military responsibilities (RÃ¶mer, 340). ; There was also a community of priests located at Lammspringe, although not organized into a chapter of canons. The priests serviced the convent and the surrounding parish churches and chapels (RÃ¶mer, 334). The community was composed of the nuns, a community of priests, and lay-brothers, who worked the covent's farms (RÃ¶mer, 349). The provost stood over both the nuns and the community of priests for the community (RÃ¶mer, 353). The community of priests developed in the direction of a chapter of canons.";FAUX

It was founded in the 8th century and often had a chapter of canons or a monastic community associated with it to serve pilgrims and manage the hospice. Saint Moderanno, a bishop of Rennes, is said to have founded a monastery here. Pieve (Abbey) of San Moderanno, Berceto (Province of Parma)  
Order while it lasted: Benedictine monks

Immediate cause of the end of the Benedictine community  
• Papal suppression and conversion into a *collegiata* (secular chapter) because the monastery had fallen to only a handful of monks and was being held *in commendam* by absentee abbots.

Sequence in brief  
1. 14th c. – decline in numbers; from 1377 the abbacy is consigned to commendatory clerics who draw the revenues but do not reside.  
2. 1459 – Visitation of the Benedictine Cassinese Congregation finds only two resident monks; recommends suppression.  
3. 8 February 1480 – bull of Pope Sixtus IV (“Ad religiosam”) suppresses the Benedictine abbey of S. Moderando and erects in its place a secular collegiate church of a provost and twelve canons subject to the bishop of Parma.  
4. Monastic assets (lands, tithes) are transferred to the new chapter; remaining monks receive pensions or are relocated to other Cassinese houses (some go to S. Giovanni Evangelista in Parma).  

After-effect  
From 1480 onward San Moderanno functions only as a parish/collegiate church (still called the “Duomo” of Berceto today); no regular monks return.  

Thus the “termination” of the Benedictine phase was not war or Napoleonic secularisation but a late-medieval papal decision to close a moribund abbey and replace it with secular clergy.";

The initial provision for the convent consisted of 1000 Marks silver; property in Wolframshausen, which gave the convent yearly 23 pigs, 90 hens, 14 schillings pennies, and portions of grain, corn, and wheat(?); farms and goods in Iphausen, Fugstadt, LÃ¶ffelsterz, Steinarch, Wieden, Sulzthal, Aschach, Stangenrod, Wolbach and other villages (Link, 586). The convent continued to prosper through gifts from the Counts of Henneberg and the Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg as well as through purchases of land. In 1287 the bishop of WÃ¼rzburg confirmed the grant of 10 acres of fields, which Berthold of Rothenkolben granted the convent upon the entrance of his daughter Gertrudis (Link, 586). In 1339 Fritz of Rothenkolben and his wife, Zacharia, gave their daughter Adelheid, a nun in the convent, a portion of grain from their property in Hollstadt; after her death, this portion should fall to their other daughter, Hille, another nun within the community. After the death of both the portion came into the possession of the convent (Link, 587).

Their Cistercian convent was founded in a valley just south of Burkardroth. The convent was well-endowed at its foundation. The convent was exempt from the power of the archdeacon and had no advocate other than the bishop of the diocese (Krausen, 39). The count acted as custodian of the convent. ; Abess Barbara III Kuchenmeister was censured in 1467 by the head of the Cistercian order because she had brought a dispute with the abbess ofÂ MarburghausenÂ before the German king (Krausen, 39). In 1525 peasant unrest caused the nuns to flee to WÃ¼rzburg, and the convent was plundered. After 1574 the convent dissolved with the death of its abbess, and the convent's possessions fell to the bishop of Wuerzburg.

According to Link, the convent moved because the abbess found its previous location ""arid, barbaric, and deprived of wood"" (Link, 589). The convent remained relatively independent of the bishop's control. The abbess had to perform obedience to the bishop and could only elect a provost for the convent with his consent; in return, the bishop recognized the convent's freedom from advocacy and tithes. The spiritual supervision over the nuns was granted to the abbot of Ebrach, later those from Langheim (Krausen, 71).

Here's what life for the Clarisse nuns in Würzburg would have been like during medieval times:

Foundation and Context:

Likely Foundation Period: The monastery was probably founded in the late 13th or early 14th century. This was the period of significant expansion for the Poor Clares and Franciscan orders throughout German-speaking lands.
Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg: Being in a powerful Prince-Bishopric meant that the monastery likely had the support or at least the approval of the Prince-Bishop. It would have been part of the rich tapestry of religious life in the city.
Franciscan Friary: As was standard, the Clarisse monastery would have been established in connection with a Franciscan friary in Würzburg (Würzburg had a very early Franciscan presence, from the 1220s). The friars provided chaplains for Mass, confessions, and spiritual direction.
Name: It was likely known as Kloster St. Klara (Monastery of St. Clare).
Life of the Clarisse Nuns (Governed by the Rule of St. Clare):

Contemplative Prayer: This was their primary purpose and ""work."" Their daily and nightly schedule revolved around the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office) chanted in choir, daily Mass, and dedicated time for mental prayer and meditation.
Strict Poverty: The nuns lived a life of radical poverty, renouncing all personal and communal property. They relied on alms from the citizens of Würzburg and the fruits of their own manual labor.
Enclosure (Cloister): They lived a strictly enclosed life within the monastery walls. Contact with the outside world was minimal and controlled (usually through a grille or a ""turn"" – a revolving window), fostering an environment dedicated to prayer.
Community Life: They lived as a community under the leadership of an Abbess, sharing all things in common, including meals (often taken in silence while listening to spiritual readings) and work.
Manual Labor: This was an integral part of their life, both as a spiritual discipline and for sustenance. In an urban German setting like Würzburg, this could include:
Spinning and Weaving: Working with wool or flax to produce cloth for their habits and other simple textiles.
Needlework and Embroidery: Creating and mending their own clothing, altar linens. Fine liturgical embroidery (""Paramentenstickerei"") was a skill in some German convents.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for vegetables and herbs (for food and simple medicinal uses).
Baking: Making their own bread.
Language: Liturgical Latin was used for prayers and Mass. Their everyday spoken language would have been German (specifically a Franconian dialect).
Significance and Interaction with Würzburg:

Spiritual Role: The nuns were seen as a source of spiritual strength for the city, praying for Würzburg, its Prince-Bishop, its clergy, and its inhabitants.
Local Support: They would have received donations (food, materials, money) from pious individuals, families, and guilds in Würzburg.
Vocations: The monastery would have attracted daughters from Würzburg's burgher (merchant and artisan) families, and possibly from lesser nobility in the surrounding Franconian region.
Challenges and Endurance Through Major Historical Periods:

Medieval Crises: They would have experienced the general hardships of the medieval era, such as plagues (the Black Death), famines, and occasional unrest.
The Reformation: Unlike many German cities where monastic orders were dissolved when Protestantism was adopted, Würzburg remained staunchly Catholic under its Prince-Bishops. This means the Klarissenkloster in Würzburg would have survived the Reformation period. This is a significant point for its history.
Thirty Years' War (1618-1648): This devastating war would have brought immense hardship and potential disruption to the monastery, as Würzburg was affected by the conflict.
Later History and Dissolution:

The monastery continued to exist for centuries after the medieval period.
Its end came with the Secularization in Bavaria in 1802/1803. During this period, following the Napoleonic Wars, vast amounts of church property, including monasteries, were confiscated by the state. The Klarissenkloster in Würzburg was dissolved at this time, bringing its long history to a close. The nuns would have been dispersed, and the buildings and lands repurposed.
In summary, the Poor Clares in medieval Würzburg lived a traditional, austere, and prayer-focused life within their enclosed monastery. Supported by the strong Catholic environment of the Prince-Bishopric, they served the community through their contemplative life and managed to persist through the Reformation, only to be dissolved during the large-scale secularizations of the early 19th century.";FAUX

Their sister Juta had joined the community previously. The three sisters were to receive three pounds Denarius yearly for their support (Link, 580). A local city-dweller, Heinrich Wender, and his wife, Petrissa, gave the convent 6 acres of vineyards. Their daughter, Berlindis, was a member of the community and retained the right of usufruct in this property for her lifetime. Agnes SchÃ¼rger and her daughter, Bertha, (who were members of the convent) received four and a half acres of vineyard in 1334. In 1359 Margareta, wife of Konrad of Lindwurm, granted the convent a variety of goods from their farm in Urfeld, including amounts of corn, wheat, oil, and hens, with the provision that her sister and daughter, who were members of the community, would have the use of these goods as well for the rest of their lives (Link, 581). According to Link, the convent came to possess large farms. Most of the convent's rents and properties were acquired through purchase. In 1324 Hohenloh, the wife of Heinrich, granted the convent goods from their/her(?) property in Bleichfeld and Effeltrecht. ; The convent's wealth was augmented by bequests and donations of property from the women themselves.";"1944 ; Agnetenkloster; Agneskloster in WÃ¼rzburg ; According to Link, a community of religious women (living presumably without a rule) existed on the location of this Clarissen convent since 1151. Since 1221 a group of female tertiaries dwelt near the chapel of S. Bartholomew. When the tertiaries transfered to the chapel of Valentius on the site of the later cloister, they were joined by members of the former religious community. With papal approval, the (unregulated) women entered the Clarissen order in 1254. The two groups formed a Clarissen convent and chose S. Agnes as their patron (Link, 580). A cloister is mentioned already in 1257. No specific founder for the community is mentioned nor are specific patrons. The convent's wealth was augmented by bequests and donations of property from the women themselves. ; In 1554 only three members of the community remained. This Clarissen convent was dissolved in 1560 by Bishop Friedrich von Wirsberg. In 1567 the Jesuits obtained the conventual buildings. ; more research necessary ; Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg. ; Known abbesses are: Mechthildis, 1270; Adelheidis, 1274; Gertrud, 1287; Hedwig, 1290; Clementia, 1290; Gertrud, 1293; Heidewigis, 1297; Clementia, 1269; Katharina, 1314; Maria or Margareta, 1324; Agnes von Bocke, 1361; Kartharina von Widder, 1373; Agatha von Riedern, 1505; Dorothea, 1529; Lucretia Hurneck, 1544; Margareta von Wildenstein, 1544; Radiana von Geinsheim, 1554; Margareta Muttlinger, 1555. ; S.

While Blaubeuren is renowned for its Benedictine heritage, a separate, enduring medieval Dominican monastery in Blaubeuren itself is not prominently documented in general historical overviews. If such a community existed, it was likely small and its history is probably subsumed within local records or more specialized studies of the Dominican Order in the Swabian region. The life within it would have followed the general patterns of Dominican contemplative life for women.

In 1203 the convent acquired additional land-holdings, a farm in Wennerde bei Sarstedt and another in Grasdorf near Hannover. In 1212 the convent was enriched through the acquisition of the tithes in Bovingehusen; these tithes played an important role in the subsequent history of the convent (Faust, 194). The convent received tithes from the following communities: Bovingehusen (1212), Eddinghausen and Oddingehusen (1241), Achem (1259), Betheln (1301), and Barfelde (1305). In subsequent years the convent acquired tithes from more distant locations: Eberholzen (1240), Gross Escherde (1268), and HÃ¶nze (1299). The tithes from Barfelde went for the support of a hospital and the tithes went for the clothes of the nuns (Faust, 205). In a document from 1219 Bishop Siegfreid I confirmed that the brothers Volkmar and Ludolf von Ysissem sold their property in Wennerde to the convent. The document of transfer from 1236 displays the development of the covent's possessions through gifts and perhaps the dowries of entering nuns. In the middle of the thirteenth century the convent acquired land-holdings in Oddingehusen, Achem and Betheln; later it acquired holdings in Gronau and in Rheden. In 1296 Knight Dietrich von Escherde gave the convent a farm and 10 acres of land in Gross Escherde. According to calculations from the documents, it is estimated that in the fourteenth century the convent held 300 acres in Bovingehusen, Oddingehusen, Eddinghausen, Achem, Betheln and Barfelde. It also possessed 250 acres in the more distant areas of Gross Escherde, Eberholzen, Rheden, Brueggen and Wallenstedt (Faust, 206). In 1324 the convent held vassals in Eddinghausen. All farmers in Betheln were required to pay tithes in produce and meat to the convent beginning in 1301 and lasting until 1811 (Faust, 206). The convent benefitted from an improved economic climate in the fourteenth century. However, many feuds towards the end of the fourteenth century brought the convent to a poverty level, as they did for the community ofÂ Lammspringe. In 1369 the convent had to sell 120 acres of land. Other sales of land followed in the fourteenth century. In 1427 the convent's burdens were lessened by the dissolution of some of the convent's responsibilities through the payment of a one-time sum (Faust, 195). The convent also relied on possession of lime for its financial upkeep (Faust, 195). ; The convent was supported through tithes and land acquisitions, some of which came from the dowries of women who entered the convent (see notable members). ; The parish church of Gross Escherde was later incorporated into the convent of Escherde.";"5755 ; Escherte (1146); Escherthe (1203); Eschert (1212); Escherte; de Escerthe (1260); Kerecescherte (1310); Kirchescherde, Altescherde, Grossescherde; Bovingehusen (1212, 1224); Eskert (1253); Esgerte (1308); Kloster Escherde ; The convent was founded in 1203 by the knight, Luppold von Escherde in Gross Escherde (today). The foundation charter was confirmed by the Bishop of Hildesheim, Hartbert. The convent was described as a ""cenobium"" with a ""conventus von famulae dei"" and the right to freely elect its provost (Faust, 193). No rule is mentioned for the community, which was established primarily to perform liturgical duties. In later documents the inhabitants were referred to as ""sanctimoniales"" (nuns), and the convent appears to have observed a Benedictine way of life (Faust, 195). The convent was originally established on two main streets; the second provost, Heinrich, sought to transfer the community to Bovingehusen due to the noise and traffic. In 1236 Bishop Konrad II confirmed the transfer of the convent to Bovingehusen (Faust, 194). ; Little information is available about the internal life of the nuns in this convent. No catalog of the library nor documents are extant. There are no textiles preserved from this convent, as appear from many other convents in Lower Saxony. According to the order of the bishop the nuns should confess before they went to Mass and communion on the following day. The convent underwent conversion to the Lutheran reform peacefully in the 1540s, but there are indications that internally the nuns did not completely adhere to Lutheran beliefs (Faust, 197). The nuns particularly objected to their new habits and the communion in both kinds (Faust, 197). In 1547 Duke Erich the Younger, the son of Elisabeth was re-converted to Catholicism and Lutheranism was forbidden in Escherde (Faust, 198). Financial difficulties, however, forced him to return the convent to his mother's care, who once again instilled the Lutheran practices. The convent was disbanded in 1625 but reestablished in 1652. ; A Liber precum (15th c.) in the Dombibliothek Hildesheim, MS: Hs. 729, has been attributed to the convent. Most of the convent's archives are located in the HauptStaatsarchiv Hannover. The Dombibliothek Beverina has the Necrology of the convent and other documents and facsimiles from the convent, as well as an inventory from 1591. ; EscherdeVerzeichnis der Stifter und KlÃ¶ster Niedersachsens vor der ReformationHandschriftenerbe des Deutschen Mittelalters, vol. 1, p. 234. ; Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Hildesheim 1-7. ; In 1264 Ermegardis, the daughter of Johann von Escherde, entered the convent. Her dowry consisted of land possessions in Gross Escherde. Likewise, when the daughter of Knight Heinrich von Barienrode became a nun in the convent in 1282, the convent acquired land in Eberholzen (Faust, 205-6). With the entrance of the daughter of Knight Eilhard von DÃ¶tzum in 1288 the convent's land holdings were increased. ; The first prioress, mentioned in 1285 and again in 1305, is M. Methildis. She was followed by Elisabeth (1315), Elisabeth (1356), Sophya (1359), Vredeke (1369), Yisebe (1378), Adelheid von Reden (Alheydis) (1393, 1394), v. Spengersche (1441), Gertrud (1469, 1473) and Mette (1494). ; It appears that the convent ran a hospital, because the tithes from Barfelde were marked for the support of this. ; (Benedictine by circa 1441; initially unknown, see foundation) ; The composition of the convent is uncertain, but from the second half of the thirteenth century daughters of the surrounding nobility entered the convent (Faust, 208). The provost elected at the time of Busch's visitation came from the noble family of Spengersche. ; In 1588 there were 7 nuns and 3 novices. ; The convent is located in the district of Hannover in the diocese of Hildesheim. ; The convent was established in Gross Eschede and moved to Bovingehusen in 1236. It was located in the duchy of Braunschweig-Lueneburg (1180-1235) and then in Hildesheim (1235-1523). ; In 1441 the convent had a visitation from the Augustinian provost Johannes Busch. According to Faust, the nuns feared that this visitation would result in attempts to impose a stricter lifestyle (Faust, 196). The visitation went well and resulted in the election of a new prioress, who along with the convent willingly accepted Busch's reforms. Busch mentions that he introduced the singing of prayers before and after the meals in the refectory. The nuns accepted a stricter discipline willingly so that Busch was satisfied with his first visit to the convent (Faust, 196). Busch introduced new ceremonies and confession prior to Mass, to which the nuns had previously been indisposed. In 1542/43 the convent experienced a Lutheran visitation. ; The convent seal depicted a seated Madonna with Christ child, and next to her, John the Evangelist and the head of John the Baptist (Faust, 215). ; Little is known about the monastic library at Escherde, only one manuscript (a Liber precum) has been potentially identified as stemming from the convent. It is located in the Dombibliothek Hildesheim, Hs. 729. According to the protestant visitation, the nuns of the convent were largely uneducated and unable to understand the Latin Bible. The reform demanded that the provost acquire a German Bible and Catechism so that the nuns could learn to read and write (Faust, 210). ; Circa 1296 the convent became a dependency of the Cistercian convent ofÂ Marienrode. ; The origin of the first members is unknown. ; There are no remains of the medieval structures of the convent. ; Until 1259 the Cistercian convent ofÂ MarienrodeÂ held the right of patronage over the parish of Betheln; in 1296 these rights were transfered to Escherde. The convent also possessed rights of patronage over the parish church in Gross Escherde (Faust, 208). ; Knight Luppold and his descendants possessed the right of advocacy over the convent. After their death the convent would be free to choose its advocate. In 1523 the convent came into the possession of Duke Erich von Calenberg-GÃ¶ttingen and belonged to the Duchy of Calenberg. ; The provost held a place of prominence in the convent, as witnessed by the continuous record of its office-holders. It is unclear whether the provost of the convent was secular or a monk, nor is it known whether he was solely responsible for the religious functions in the convent or whether he was aided by priests (Faust, 194). The convent did have lay brothers, who were responsible for the work outside of the convnet. Documents mention a prioress, sub-prioress, chamberlain, cook, and [window woman?] (Fensterfrau).";FAUX

During the sixteenth century the convent suffered economic difficulties. In 1509 the abbot of Ebrach established an administrator over the convent's properties and in 1514 he tried to reestablish claustration. In 1525 the nuns fled from the Peasant Uprising into WÃ¼rzburg (Krausen, 88). ; The purchase sum for S.

Friedrich placed his foundation under the protection of S. Kilian and ensured that the property of the foundation was free from any secular advocate. The new foundation was confirmed in 1189 by Bishop Gottfried of WÃ¼rzburg. Pope Clement III confirmed the foundation in the following year and also confirmed the convent's freedom from tithes (Krausen, 87). In 1192 the convent received the imperial protection of King Heinrich VI. The community was a double house. ; The convent went into decline in the thirteenth century. Countess Adelheid of Rieneck asked the General Chapter of Citeaux to help save the convent. In 1248/50 the deserted convent provided support for nuns from Himmelstadt until they were settled by Bishop Hermann of Lobdeburg in the Schottenau near WÃ¼rzburg (Krausen, 88). The convent continued to be supported through gifts until the sixteenth century. Again in the sixteenth century the convent experienced economic difficulties and was plundered during the Peasant Uprising in 1525. The abbess Cecilia of KÃ¶nigsfeld tried to renew the convent, requesting nuns from Meiningen. When they were unable to obtain nuns from there, four choir and two lay-sisters were sent from Kroppenstedt in September 1538. however, the convent protested to the bishop and the father abbot that they were Benedictines (and not from their order) (Krausen, 88). The bishop declared against the ""foreigners"" and with the failure of her reform effort Abbess Cecilia resigned. In 1564 the convent (having become deserted) was conveyed into the hands of the bishop and dissolved. In 1699 the bishop transfered the community to the minorites of WÃ¼rzburg. ; need to verify double house ; The convent's archives are located in the Hauptstaatsarchiv in MÃ¼nchen (Munich) and in the Staatsarchiv in WÃ¼rzburg. ; Die KlÃ¶ster des Zisterzienserordens in Bayern ; Known abbesses are: Christina, 1304; Gisela (daughter of Heinrich Leyse of Rieneck), 1323; Adelheid of Rieneck, 1361; Katharina, 1401 and Anna, prioress; Kunigunde of Wiesenthauw, 1485; Caecilie, 1503.

At the time of foundation, the charter records that the nobles,Gerlach and Heinrich, bestowed on the convent the property from the farms and land from the church of S. Peter to the old buildings of S. Mary. It is unclear whether these two churches became part of the cloister-complex; Kappelhoff contends that the church of S. Peter definitely did not become a church for the convent, as no records of altars or chapels dedicated to the saint exist in the conventual records (Kappelhoff, 136). He also believe that the buildings of S. Mary refer to buildings which were no longer used as a church. The nobles also conveyed to water-mills into the possession of the convent (Kappelhoff, 148). The convent also recieved all the cultivated and uncultivated land on the east bank of the Este river from Buxtehude to the north ""up to the people of Holland"" (Kappelhoff, 148). The nobles also gave the community possessions in Zesterbach in modern Borstel and three hides of land on the Este River. The convent received tithes from these areas as well. From the property of Floria the convent recieved four hides and a quarter-hide on the Este. The property of the parish church in Buxtehude encompassed 49 and a half hides in Eilendorf, Immenbeck, Ardesdorf, Villenhusen, Pippensen, Hollenstedt, Eversen, Grauen, Sproetze, Hosterem, Walesdorpe, Tostedt, Ottensen, Rahmsdorf, Wulmsdorf, Drestedt, Ludelmesdorpe, Trintlo, Eckhorst, Oersdorf, Stelle, Adelmesdorpe, Oldendorf and Goldbeck (Kappelhoff, 148). It also included tithes from eight farms in Villenhusen and Immenbeck. During the fourteenth century the convent expanded its possessions (both in tithes and land) in a methodical way. ; Initially, the convent seems to have been well-endowed (see assets/property below). The convent faced economic difficulties because of the foundation of the new city of Buxtehude by Archbishop Giselbert of Bremen circa 1285. The archbishop took portions of the convent property and placed the convent under his power of excommunication (Kappelhoff, 137). The convent suffered damages in a conflict between the dukes of LÃ¼neburg and Duke Albrecht of Saxony; a document of March 1, 1287 records the damages done to the convent, primarily due to the nearness of the city and the loss of income from tithes, taxes and tolls. The use of the moors and fields were returned to the convent (Kappelhoff, 138). The convent also recieved a portion of its land back. Damages were repaid by 250 Mark of Stade pennies. The proximity of the new town infringed upon the ability of the convent to develop economically. Despite the proximity of the town, the convent prospered during the fourteenth century. In fact, the convent appears to have been able to rebuild itself after damage incurred during the 1420s without recourse to any loans (Kappelhoff, 149). However, under Provost Johannes Glasewerth the convent again suffered economic difficulties that led to the provost's resignation and the election of Hienrich Brunow. By his death in 1476, the convent was again in better economic circumstances. ; The convent also engaged in the provision of rents to farmers from deposits of credit (loaning activities?). ; The convent incorporated the parish of modern EstebrÃ¼gge in 1388. This was confirmed in 1389 by Pope Urban VI.";"10634 ; Altbuxtehude; claustrum in Buxtehude, monasterium in Buxtehuden, ecclesia sancti Laurentii, Closters Olden Buxtehude, Olden Kloster; Coenobium vetus ; At the diocean synod in 1197, the noble half-brotheres Gerlach and Heinrich, heinrich's wife Floria, and a monk named Sigeband came before Bishop Rudolf of Verden and declared their desire to found a monastery with the help of the bishop (Kappelhoff, 135). The archbishop of Hollenstedt accompanied the group to show his support for the foundation as well. The rights of patronage and advocacy in Buxtehude were handed over to the church in Verden. The convent was founded from a portion of the brothers' allodial property. Bishop Rudolf confirmed that no bishop or provost would be able to hold the advocacy over Buxtehude as a fief (Kappelhoff, 135). Advocates could only be used when needed and were afterwards to be set aside. Floria, the wife of Heinrich, contributed portions of her personal property to the community. At a general synod in the bishopric of Modestorf, all the rights and the formal foundation of Buxtehude were confirmed. The bishop established the Benedictine Rule for the nuns of the community and the monk Sigeband was established as the first provost (Kappelhoff, 135). Future provosts were to be elected by the convent in conjunction with the bishop. The bishop held the right of investiture. ; Kappelhoff believes that devotion to S. Laurentius arrived in the late tenth century in Buxtehude and reached its highpoint in the twelfth century. In 1479 the provost Johannes Murmester along with Magister Gerhard Halepaghen, father-confessor to the nuns, undertook an internal reform of the convent. The reform focused on stricter claustration. The reform was aided by the prioress ofÂ Ebstorf, which had alreadly undertaken the refrom of te Neukloster in 1477. The previous prioress was replaced by a new prioress, Gertrud Rammes, previously subprioress ofÂ EbstorfÂ (Kappelhoff, 140). On December 1, 1499 the nuns were told to evacuate the convent, because of the threat of the army ammassed during the conflict between the dukes of Sachsen-Lauenburg and the Archbishop of Bremen. Once the nuns had been evacuated, the convent buildings were plundered by the citizens. The army then seized the buildings and held them until December 19, 1499. Once the army evacuated, the citizens again stormed the buildings and set them on fire (Kappelhoff, 142). The influence of the Protestant Reformation made itself felt in the town of Buxtehude beginning in 1535. Heinrich Soth became the first Protestant provost of the community. The nuns, however, continued to adhere to the Catholic faith. This conflict ultimately led to a disputation between the two faiths within the convent of Altkloster. In 1618 the archbishop along with the mayors of Buxtehude secured the retention of the catholic worship in the convent and promised that no new songs would be introduced (Kappelhoff, 144). Circa 1635-1636 the convent again recieved dispensation to exercise the catholic religion freely and have catholic priests (Kappelhoff, 146). ; At the time of foundation, the convent further recieved rights and property in the shrines to S. Mary and S. Laurentius, which Sigeband brought back to and established in the convent at Buxtehude. The two saints became the patrons of the convent. ; Most of the archives for this community are found in the Niederdeutsches Staatarchiv Stade. The medieval holdings encompass roughly 630 documents on Pergament, from 1197-1674. The King's(?) Library in Copenhagen also possesses a document from the community, #Thott. 8o8 (25a). ; Buxtehude, AltklosterHandschriftenerbe des Deutschen Mittelalters, vol. 1, p. 143. ; [1]HODEENBERG, W. v., ed.

In 1196 the convent also acquired two water-mills. The convent acquired further possessions in this area through purchase, predominantly of tithes (Kappelhoff, 148). The foundation of the city of Buxtehude in the thirteenth century brought a significant decline in the convent's economy; it lost tithes, tolls, and taxes. In 1287 the convent received a portion of its possessions and rights back along with 250 Marks for damages done to the convent. The money was used to purches further possessions (Kappelhoff, 149). The convent (perhaps at this time) acquired four salt-pans. ; Benedictine ; The community was composed of noble women; the family of the Schultes played a prominent role in the convent. It also included the patrician daughters from LÃ¼neburg and Hamburg. Kappelhoff believes the convent remained open to anyone who could afford the dowry requirement (Kappelhoff, 150). ; In 1389 there were approximately 60 nuns in the community. In 1499 there were 67 persons in the convent, including novices and lay sisters. In 1515 there were 81 people in the convent, including 58 nuns, 18 novices, 13 lay-sisters, and a widow. ; Buxtehude, in the administrative district of Stade ; The convent was located in Buxtehude in the county of Stade (until 1144); this territory was disputed between the dukes of Saxony and the archbishop of Bremen, circa 1236 it fell to Bremen. ; Kappelhoff believes that the church of S. Mary and Laurentius recorded in the foundation document of 1196 was already old, otherwise it would not have been so richly equipped as it appears in the earliest documents (Kappelhoff, 137). Sometime during the 1420s the community's buildings were burnt with the seige of Buxtehude by the Dukes of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg. On December 1, 1499 the nuns were told to evacuate the convent, because of the threat of the army ammassed during the conflict between the dukes of Sachsen-Lauenburg and the Archbishop of Bremen. Once the nuns had been evacuated, the convent buildings were plundered by the citizens. The army then seized the buildings and held them until December 19, 1499. Once the army evacuated, the citizens again stormed the buildings and set them on fire (Kappelhoff, 142). The convent was then rebuilt, despite attempts to disperse the nuns among the four other convents in the Lueneburg heath. On July 15, 1500 the nuns again assumed possession of the convent (Kappelhoff, 142). Based on archaeological research, the convent church appears to have had two trancepts with dimensions of 30 meters by 10 meters. It was presumably built in a style of Brick-Gothic with an East Gable (perhaps similar toÂ Wienhausen). The convent had a clock tower. The convent itself was a two-storied half-timbered building. The south-wing of the convent presumably held the refectory and kitchen. There were also several other buildings with specialized functions (Kappelhoff, 153). ; An inventory of 1669 lists several art objects, statues, pictures, riches, and liturgical items. However, it is unclear whether some or all of these were used during the Middle Ages. The inventory also lists ""robes/clothes"" for the statues, which were presumably fashioned by the nuns. Again, these can not be dated to the medieval period with certainty. ; Besides S. Mary and S. Laurentius, the convent mentions S. Nicolaus (1290), S. Stephan (1337), S. Katherine (1344), and S. Bartholomew (1393) as saintly patrons (Kappelhoff, 154). A seal from the convent, from the year 1356, depicts S. Laurentius with a book before his chest with stars behind him. ; Little is known about the convent's library. ; It is not known from where the first nuns for the community came. It is possible that the first nuns came from the neighboring convent ofÂ LÃ¼ne. The provost ofÂ LÃ¼neÂ was present at the synod in Modestorff. The provost fromÂ EbstorfÂ was also present, although at this time the community was composed of Premonstratensian canons, so that settlement from this community is highly unlikely (Kappelhoff, 137). ; The provost of Altkloster in Buxtehude also acted as the rector for all the churches and chapels within the city. In 1304 a curacy and altar to S. Laurentius was established within the Peter's church in Buxtehude, of which the provost of Altkloster was the founder. The provost founded these and provided them with income, primarily for the support of priest (Kappelhoff, 139). The S. Peter's church, although never formally incorporated, came under the influence of the convent; the convent also exercised control over the chapels in Buxtehude, including the Beloved Mother (Liebfrau) chapel, the S. Anne chapel, and the chapel of the Holy Spirit at the hospital (Kappelhoff, 151). With the Reformation, the convent lost its control over these.Â EbstorfÂ continued to exert influence over the convent until 1530. ; It is unclear who held the right of protectorship over the convent. In the foundation documents, the nobles of Buxtehude possessed the rights of patronage and protectorship over the goods and lands of the Buxtehude parish church. The document, however, also prohibits the provost and bishop from passing on the rights of protectorship as an inheritance (Kappelhoff, 150). ; Although the convent underwent an internal reform in 1479, it was not formally incorporated into the Bursfeld congregation. ; The foundation charter from December 25-31, 1196 still exists.";FAUX

The convent also received a portion of moorland in 1274. The convent retained these possessions even after it was transferred to Bredenbeck in 1286. In 1302 the convent sold its income from salt in LÃ¼neburg and acquired a farm in Grauen (Bohmbach, 449). The convent held patronage rights in Neukirchen (since 1286) and Bliedersdorf (before 1570-1638). The first detailed documentation of the convent's holdings comes from an inventory of 1335. According to this document, the convent had acquired through gifts houses in Mekkelsen and Holwede; a farm in Twielenfleth; land in RÃ¼bke, Huttfleth, HamelwÃ¶rden, and Wisch; a salt rent in LÃ¼neburg; and the new church in Lu with land and a farm in Nottensdorf (Bohmbach, 453). The convent also acquired tithes in Sittensen, Daghestorp, Grundoldendorf, Hardestorp, Hedendorf, Wulmstorf, Sotrumm, Vierden, and Frankop, which totaled approximately 2000 Marks. The convent held land and farms in Meckelsen, Holwede, Geldbeck, Emmen, hardestorp, Hedendorf, EstebrÃ¼gge, Leswig, RÃ¼bke, Frankop, Jork, Neuenkirchen, Huttfleth, Hollern, Wethe, Assel, and Oldenbetenen, amounting to 1200 Marks. The convent's holdings, which totaled more than 3000 Marks since 1300, were concentrated in the land and city of Geest, primarily south-east of the LÃ¼he river. The convent also held numerous rights in the saltworks in LÃ¼neburg. In the mid-fourteenth century, the convent received further donations from the city council of LÃ¼neburg (Bohmbach, 453). The community's assets and property remained much the same after 1350 despite the occurrence of sales and gifts. In 1363 the convent acquired a farm in Wisch with 44 hides. In 1385 Marquard of Zesterfleth gave the convent his house and farm near the mill in Buxtehude; in 1391 the convent sold this for 230 Marks to the city council of Buxtehude. Particularly important among the convent's possessions were its portion of the forest in Buxtehude. The rights of both Buxtehude convents were frequently threatened by the citizens of Horneburg (see litigations). The fifteenth century witnessed increased donations to the convent by the citizens of Hamburg; in 1445 the city council established a book to record entries of donations to the convent. From 1445-1460 the convent received an income from rent of 6.067 1/2 Marks. The donations and income coming from Hamburg are likely a result of the convent's role in educating and caring for the daughters of wealthy Hamburg families. The fifteenth century, however, also witnessed a drastic decline in the convent's income, evidenced by the nuns' begging at the biannual markets in Stade and the 1465 decree that new entrants must receive a pension of 3-4 Marks that would fall to the convent upon their death (Bohmbach, 454). (See relative wealth) An income register of 1479 indicates that the convent held only the tithes in Bliedersdorf, Wulmstorf, Nienkop, and Neuenkirchen; property and assets in Hedendorf, Nottensdorf, Daghestorp, Wiersdorf, Sittensen, Vierden, Kehdingen, and Hollern, Steinkirchen, Mittelnkirchen, Jork, Borstel, EstebrÃ¼gge, and Nienkop had been given up or sold. ; The first systematic compilation of the community's holdings was made in 1335 and seems to indicate that the convent had substantial wealth. The convent appears to reflect a positive economic development throughout the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century, the community experienced some economic decline. In 1454 Clau Tamme, from the city of Stade, granted a yearly annuity to the convent of 5 Marks, so that the nuns living there no longer had to beg at the biannual markets in Stade. Such a grant appears to indicate the difficult economic position of the community at that time. Likewise, sometime before Septermber 1465, Bishop Johann of Verden decreed that on account of the number of nuns and the poverty of the community no more nuns might be accepted into the community without an annuity of 3-4 Marks, which would fall to the convent upon their death. The convent had clearly exceeded the bounds of its economic means. In 1473 the Bishop also declared that the convent could not join the Bursfeld reform due to its limited economic means; the convent was so poor it had only one cooking pot (Bohmbach, 450). In 1495 the convent appealed to the mayor of LÃ¼neburg, Cord Lange, for aid, due to its financial difficulties. The same year the convent received aid from the city council (Bohmbach, 451). In 1499 the convent was destroyed and the nuns were forced to reside in the residences of citizens of Buxtehude. The convent was able to be rebuilt due primarily to the support of LÃ¼neburg. The destruction and rebuilding presumably left the convent in great poverty. A now-lost income register for 1600-1608 recorded the convent's income at about 1600 Marks at that time; half of its fourteenth-century income (Bohmbach, 455). ; The convent was known for its education of daughters of the Hamburg patriciate. In 1445 the mayor and city council created a special book to enter all the grants of annuities to the convent, and in the second half of the fifteenth century the convent received considerable sums. ; The church in Bliedersdorf was incorporated into the convent's holdings sometime prior to 1570. In 1573 the parish complained to the provost of Neukloster, who cared for the church's goods, that he was neglecting to care for the building and the regular performance of services on Sundays and Feastdays (Bohmbach, 451).";"9357 ; Neukloster (Bredenbeck); Neukloster bei Buxtehude; novi claustri in Lu (1286); novi claustri apud Buxtehude (1302) ; The convent was founded from property bestowed by Johannes Schulte, a member of one of the most important ministerial families in the region of LÃ¼he, in 1270. Johannes founded the convent as a pious gesture and with a mind for the future care of his soul, since he lacked any heirs. On April 22, 1270 Bishop Conrad of Verden confirmed the construction of a new church on the property of Johannes Schulte, south of the LÃ¼he. In 1274 the foundation was transformed into a Benedictine convent, and the convent assumed the Benedictine rule. Johannes Schulte, his wife Hildeburg, and the cathedral deacon of Verden were all involved in this establishment. The first nuns came fromÂ Buxtehude, Altkloster. The prioress and nuns were allowed to assume the same habit as their mother-house and obtained the privilege to freely elect their provosts. In 1283/1286 Schulte and the provost John decided to transfer the convent to the more fruitful location of Bredenbeke. (The convent remained in Buxtehude less than 10 years). After the convent was moved to Bredenbeck, it was placed within the jursidiction ofÂ Buxtehude, Altkloster, which then transferred its legal rights in Bredenbeck to the new convent in return for a payment of 10 Marks gold by Johannes Schulte. After the convent's transfer, the nuns assumed a gray habit in place of their black ones. In 1286 Bishop Conrad of Verden gave his approval for this change in habit, but prohibited the convent from ever electing an abbess. It was only allowed to elect a provost and prioress. They may have been influenced by neighboring Cistercian communities. In 1332, however, the convent returned (again?) to the Benedictine order (Bohmbach, 448-449). ; In 1481 Bishop Bertold of Verden confirmed the convents' request to be freed from its responsibility for holding numerous requiem masses, which prevented the nuns from strict adherence to the rule (Bohmbach, 450). Despite the Protestant Reformation, Neukloster remained adamently Catholic. Up until 1569, Catholic masses were still held in its church. ; The convent's archive is held in the Staatsarchiv in Stade 1324-1610 (Urk. Neukloster Nr. 1-15).

In 1332 the provost and convent appealed to the pope over the family's hinderence of the community's rights in these areas. In 1335 the Archbishop Burchard of Bremen and Bishop Johann of Verden established a definite area of the forest held by the two convents. In 1418 Iwan de Borch claimed the protectorship over the forest in Buxtehude, which provosts from bothÂ Buxtehude, AltklosterÂ and Neukloster denied. The provosts claimed that this protectorship was granted out on a yearly basis and not hereditary, as Iwan claimed. In 1443 a new conflict arose with Johann von Borch over the borders of the portions of forest owned by the convent (Bohmbach, 449). The result was that the portions established in 1335 as belonging to the convents were re-confirmed (Bohmbach, 454). In 1472 the right of the convents to cut wood within the forest was again re-confirmed. In 1575 a dispute arose between the convent and its provost. The prioress and convent complained that the provost neglected the care of the community's goods on account of his being married and asked the archbishop for permission to elect another provost. The archbishop denied the convent's request, but his decree also seems to indicate the end of provosts' residence within the cloister (Bohmbach, 451-2). ; Benedictine ; Most of the nuns appear to have been drawn from the surrounding cities of Hamburg, Buxtehude, Stade and LÃ¼neburg. ; The number of inhabitants in the community in the medieval period is unknown. In 1600 the community included 23 nuns, 16 conversae, the provost, chaplain, and confessor, totalling 42 inhabitants. The convent also had a girls' school with 12-16 girls, who were taught for 30 Marks per year (Bohmbach, 455). In 1611 the still-Catholic convent held 37 members; this had shrunk to 18 by 1625 and 9 by 1650. By 1685 there remained only 2 Catholic and 1 Evangelical inhabitants; the last inhabitant died in 1705. ; Buxtehude; in the district of Stade ; The convent was founded by Neuenkirchen (New Church) in Buxtehude. ; Towards the end of 1477 the convent received three visitations from the Bishop of Verden, the prior of S. Michael in LÃ¼neburg, the provost ofÂ EbstorfÂ and Master of Buxtehude, Gerhard Halepaghen, in order to be reformed. The provost ofÂ EbstorfÂ presented the convent with 5 nuns from that community to help with the reform. At this time the prioress and subprioress of Neukloster resigned, and Gertrud de Brake and Gertrud Kammis were elected as prioress and subprioress. The provost and prioress were charged to closely moniter the nuns' claustration (Bohmbach, 450). ; The conventual church, built circa 1300, was a single-nave brick structure with a pentagonal apse in the east and west. The cloister buttressed the church on the northern wall. In 1499 the convent was destroyed. In March 1500 the prioress and convent wrote to LÃ¼neburg that the church, choir, and total convent had burned, requiring the nuns to dwell in the houses of pious laity in the city of Buxtehude. The city council of LÃ¼neburg sent 60 Marks and lime for the rebuilding, and in the following year it supplied windows for the new church. The convent was apparently rebuilt in a rather unaltered form. In 1902 the church and convent was demolished due to its state of ruin. The altar (c. 1500) and crucifix (c. 1400) were transferred to the new church (Bohmbach, 456). ; The provost's seal from 1377 is still extant. It depicts the Madonna with child under a Baldachine in an oval frame. The convent's seal is round and depicts the Madonna and child. Both are in a poor state of preservation. Two chalices dating from between the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries are still extant. ; The convent received numerous grants and bequests from the families in the neighboring cities of Hamburg, Buxtehude, Stade, and LÃ¼neburg. In the fourteenth century the convent acquired substantial holdings through the noble families of Schulte, Borch, von Eschete, von Bliederstorpe, and from the old Stade patrician families of De Cimiterio and de Arena (Bohmbach, 453). ; Buxtehude, Altkloster ; The first nuns came fromÂ Buxtehude, Altkloster.

It was founded after Eilivsson had returned unharmed to Norway after having participated in the Norwegian Crusade to Jerusalem of Sigurd the Crusader in circa 1110. Their daughter Baugeid Dagsdatter (d. after 1161) later became an abbess there. His son and successor Gregorius Dagsson (d. 1161) is commonly reported to have been buried there.[4][5]

It is counted as the first monastery in Norway founded for women. The year of foundation is unknown. It is regarded as the perhaps first convent in Norway, and was thus founded prior to the second eldest convents of Norway, which were mostly all founded in about 1150. The convent was built in stone and is estimated to have been built by English masons, and its first nuns were also from England. The abbey was well positioned on the navigable river on the way to Skien, and was gradually enlarged and endowed with numerous estates during the centuries.[6]

The abbey eventually came in to financial troubles. By about 1500, the premises had been mortgaged, although the nuns continued to live there. The Reformation in 1537 caused the dissolution of the nunnery, but the nuns were permitted to stay in residence until 1540, when they were forced to leave by order of the king. The buildings burnt to the ground in 1546, and the site was cleared. Today there are no traces of buildings above ground level. The island was taken over by the Crown as a state property and was sold in 1662.";

Duke Wilhelm confirmed the new foundation in 1437. In 1453 the community moved to Detmold. In 1470 the convent suffered from the acquisition of the Eldagsen by the Counts of Schaumburg. The convent purchased a farm and mill in Badersleben fromÂ HuysburgÂ in 1479 to prevent its relocation and founded the convent of Marienbeke there. From Marienbecke followed new foundations in Detmold and Lemgo. According to one manuscript, the convent of Dietenborn was also founded by the community of Marienbecke (Hoogeweg, 33). However, Dietenborn is an older foundation than Marienbecke and the manuscript may refer to a period of support in the sixteenth century (Hoogeweg, 33). ; The convent likely dissolved in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.

The convent also held possessions in the northern diocese of Verden and Bremen. At the main farm of the convent in Wichmannsburg the convent possessed 29 hides of land which it loaned out, 12 hides ""de indominicata terra"" and three houses as well as 20 villages (RÃ¶mer, 311). Almost all of the property once held by the earlier community had been given out as fiefs or become inheritable property by the time the convent was reestablished as a Benedictine priory; the convent thus relied on gifts and purchase to establish its income once again. From 1194 onwards the community possessed only Kemnade completely and retained considerable properties in Heyen and Rene (RÃ¶mer, 317). In the thirteenth century the convent strived to re-acquire property that had been loaned or alienated. Since 1206/1216 the convent's holdings tended to come from the holdings of nobles in primarily three areas: the nobles from Kemnade, from Bishoperode, and from Osterrode, which the convent purchased from the time of Provost Konrad von Homburg. The convent purchased or acquired the land-holdings of the nobles, primarily the Homburgs, within the region of Kemnade. By 1305/9 no more noble holdings existed within Kemnade (RÃ¶mer, 317). In 1219 Abbot Hugo of Corvey conveyed these holdings to the convent; the holdings had been held by the lords of Homburg as fiefs and had once belonged to Corvey itself (RÃ¶mer, 302). In 1298 the convent leased the large farm in Heyen from its Homburg lord, in return for the payment of a third of the fruits of the property (RÃ¶mer, 317). In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the convent sold and exchanged its alienated properties. The convent did retain its rents in the saltworks of LÃ¼neburg (1306) as well as the rents from Salzhemmendorf (1339) and from Hammeln(1365). In 1333 the convent purchased a property in Scharnebeck from the convent Scharnebeck. Likewise in 1333Â MedingenÂ purchased control over income from Geesthacht and S. Dionys from Kemnade (RÃ¶mer, 312). In the fourteenth century the convent's property shrank to the areas surrounding the Weser River. In the course of the sixteenth century, the convent came to control almost completely the district of Kemnade, as the local nobility repeatedly conveyed their land in this area to the convent (RÃ¶mer, 312). To the right of the Weser in the district of Wickensen, the possessions of the convent were the most extensive. In the village of Heyen, the convent must have possessed over half of the fields (RÃ¶mer, 313). The convent had further possessions in the villages of Daspe (1243: one hide; 1309: 2 hides); Kreipke (before 1400: 1/2 a hide); Linse (1226: possessions/estates); Uppendorf bei Dohnsen (1410: 2 hides exchanged with some in Halle). In 1309 the convent acquired a farm with two hides in Grave, and in DÃ¶lme the convent acquired one hide from Corvey (RÃ¶mer, 313). The convent also acquired properties from the sovereignty of the dukedom of Calenburg and the community received tithes from the city of Bodenwerder. In Pegestorf, south of Bodenwerder, documents record the receipt of a hide in 1283, 1284, and 1295 (RÃ¶mer, 313). The convent also held land in Esperde, BÃ¶rry, Latferde (4-41/2 hides from a gift of Luckhardis von Homburg), in Grohnde and in Snesle (4 hides and a farm). ; In the fifteenth century the convent's rights became more restricted.";"13148 ; Caminata; Monasterium . . . virginis Mariae . . .

Margarethae (1507) ; In 959/965 a chapter of canonesses was established in Kemnade by two daughters of Count Wichmann the Elder, Frederunde and Imma, sisters of Duke Gero. The charter of confirmation from King Heinrich II in 1004 recorded the foundresses as Frederuna, the first abbess, and her sister Imma, the succeeding abbess. The two sisters were supported in the foundation by the Count Gero (d. 965). The convent was dedicated to Mary. The founders conveyed their entire property in Kemnade and in other areas to support the new community (RÃ¶mer, 298). The community was confirmed by King Heinrich II in 1004 and 1017, and later by Konrad II in 1025 and Heinrich III in 1039. In 1017 the Heinrich II confirmed the community's right to the free election of its abbess and provost, although the king exerted influence on these elections (RÃ¶mer, 299). It appears that the canonesses followed the Benedictine rule. In 1046 the convent church was consecrated by the episcopal Bishop Bruno of Minden. King Konrad III incorporated the community in 1147 into the abbey of Corvey and transfered it into the abbey's protection (Hoogeweg, 74). After 1147 Abbot Wibald of Corvey disolved the chapter of canonesses at Kemnade and transformed it into a dependency of Corvey (although it is likely the canonesses retained the right to continue dwelling at Kemnade). From circa 1150-1194 the community was composed of monks (RÃ¶mer, 300). In 1194 Benedictine nuns from S. Peters' convent in Gehrden, north of Warburg in the diocese of Paderborn, assumed possession of the site (RÃ¶mer, 301). It is likely that the abbot of Corvey was involved in this reestablishment. From 1194-1579 Kemnade existed as a regular Benedictine convent. The nuns from Gehrden followed a particularly strict observance of the Benedictine rule and had lived as ""pauperes Christi"" at Iburg near Driburg until 1142 (RÃ¶mer, 301). According to the fifteenth-century chronicle of the house, Jutta was also responsible for bringing the nuns from Gehrden to Kemnade and for instituting the reform of the house. From 1147 on the community no longer held the right to freely elect its provosts; this right was retained by Corvey. ; The convent had two altars dedicated to Jacob, Andreas, and Erasmus and the Holy Cross, Katherine, and Barbara respectively. In 1410 the convent also had a chapel dedicated to S. Peter and Paul; priests for this chapel are mentioned in 1425, 1440 and 1449 (RÃ¶mer, 304). The convent underwent a reform beginning in 1501-1505. The reform concerned primarily the increased claustration of the nuns (RÃ¶mer, 306). The convent was also freed from the oversight of Corvey. In return the convent promised duke Heinrich the Elder, who had supported the reform, a yearly mass for his soul. In return, the convent obtained the right to lease out the spiritual fief of the Homburger chapel (RÃ¶mer, 306). The duke also conferred on the convent the ""service"" from the village of Kemnade and certain rights regarding marriages, which brought important benefits to the convent (RÃ¶mer, 306). The convent faced economic sanctions from Heinrich the Younger, who wished to impose Lutheranism in his territories. From 1549-1556 the convent experienced a brief revival of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, but this was ended by Duke Julius. By August 22, 1579 the convent had finally dissolved and all the nuns had left its compound (RÃ¶mer, 309). The abbot of Corvey complained strongly against the dissolution of the convent and the Dukes' involvement in this matter. Kemnade reverted to being a holding of Corvey without a convent, as it had been c. 1170-1194. ; link to Iburg and S.

Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum I: Monumenta Corbeiensia. Berlin, 1864. ; The first leaders of the convent, when it served as a chapter of canonesses, are called abbesses, but later leaders are termed prioresses. The known abbesses of the chapter of canonesses at Kemnade from 959/965-1147 are: Federuna (Billungerin) (959/965-1025); Imma (Billungerin); Judith (1039); Judith (also the abbess of Eschwege andÂ GesekeÂ (1143-1146); Helmburgis (1146-1147). In 1144 Jutta, who had also served as the abbess of Eschwege andÂ Geseke, became the abbess of Kemnade. Her brother Heinrich was abbot of Corvey in 1143 but disposed by the cardinal legate in 1146, at which time Jutta also had to resign her position as abbess. The criticism of Jutta's ""worldly"" lifestyle had a political component as the new abbot of Corvey, Wibald von Stablo, sought to bring the convent under the control of Corvey (RÃ¶mer, 300). He dissolved the chapter of canonesses and transformed the site into a dependency of the abbey. When the convent was refounded as a Benedictine priory, the following women served as prioresses: Judith (Jutta), 1194; Kunigunde 1236/1239-1245; Margarete, c. 1283; Alheid, 1302-1312; Placidia v.

Bocholtz, c. 1571-1579 (RÃ¶mer, 326). Non-noble prioresses were Antonia Holtsadel 1460-1477 and Mette Veerneuessen, 1500-1504. ; The convent derived tithes from nearby communities, primarily Kemnade, Berbon near Bodenwerder, Heyen, Grave and Vesper, near LÃ¼dge (RÃ¶mer, 314). All except for the last community lay within the diocese of Minden. The convent acquired these tithes through gifts from the dukes and nobles of the area between 1263 and 1347. The personal property of the convent, however, was free of tithes (RÃ¶mer, 314). The convent acquired its tithes in Heyen in 1316 from the bishop of Minden. The convent became the primary tithe-holder in the village of Grave between 1335 and 1483 (RÃ¶mer, 315). The tithes in Vesper bei LÃ¼gde came from the knightly families of the area (a tenth of them in 1314 and a fourth of them in 1343 came from such gifts). In the fifteenth century the convent's possession of tithes declined, and by 1427 1/8 of the convent's tithes from Kemnade had been sold (RÃ¶mer, 318). The total income and property of the convent may be divided into three categories: the total conventual income (administrated by the abbot of Corvey and the provost of Kemnade); the property of the priests (incompassing the provost's income or individual income of the priests); and finally, the income of the convent itself (composed of the income of the prioress, celleraria, and female inhabitants) (RÃ¶mer, 322). ; Benedictine ; In the fourteenth century the presence of local nobility increased in the convent, both in its inhabitants and in its benefactors (RÃ¶mer, 303). The exact social composition of the community remains unknown; although women of the lower nobility dominated the conventual offices in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (RÃ¶mer, 320). Sophie and Alheidis of Homburg are mentioned as nuns in 1304/5, and Mette of Homburg in 1404-1409. ; King Konrad III incorporated the community in 1147 into the abbey of Corvey and transfered it into the abbey's protection (Hoogeweg, 74). The convent was under the control of Corvey from approximately 1150-1194. In 1162 the abbot of Corvey instituted S. Margaret as a patron along with S. Mary (see below). ; situated on the Weser river ; The conventual church, built during the eleventh century, still exists, although it is currently only half the size it was in the Middle Ages. Originally the church had apses to the sides and a longer nave and ended in a west facade with towers (RÃ¶mer, 324-5). The western portion of the church held the nun's choir. In the late thirteenth century the convent undertook a rennovation and building program. This renewal revolved primarily around the cloister buildings, as the church itself was not renovated in the gothic style (RÃ¶mer, 302). Reference to a refectory, kitchen, bakehouse, and bathing house appear in 1389. In 1334 a chapel to S. Peter is also mentioned (RÃ¶mer, 325). (See present state of medieval structure) ; Wooden crucifixes from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries remain. In the fifteenth century the convent had an altar dedicated to Mary, which held a figure of S. Adriane, the patron of the Benedictine nuns atÂ Lammspringe. A carved figure of the Madonna enthroned also belonged to the convent, although it is unclear whether these art objects belonged to the nuns' choir (RÃ¶mer, 304-5). An altar to S. Dionysius is mentioned in 1149. A figure of Christ in Misery from the end of the fifteenth century and a pieta (c. 1500) still survive, as does a case for the sacrament with the figures of the apostles Peter and Paul from circa 1500 (RÃ¶mer, 325). No accounts of the artworks within the convent exist from the Middle Ages. A report from the Lutheran officials in 1579 record two altars and a number of missals, graduals, crucifixes, pictures or figures, a chalice, and box for the host, altar-clothes, lights, and robes for the priests and deacons (RÃ¶mer, 325). ; Ebstorf ; The lords of Homburg acted as patrons of the community, beginning during the thirteenth century. In fact, along with the Cistercian convent of Amelungsborn, the convent was the second proprietary monastery of the dynasty (RÃ¶mer, 301). The Counts of Pyrmont and other noble families acted as patrons of the community as well. From the end of the thirteenth century, the nuns demanded that the patrons indicate a purpose for their bequests and gifts: either for the refectory, for the clothing of the nuns, or for the infirmary (RÃ¶mer, 303). The last large foundation that the convent received, for the altar of the Holy Cross, S. Erasmus, and the 11,000 virgins, was obtained in 1522 from the parish (cleric?) Barthold Bindemann of Heyen (RÃ¶mer, 306). ; When Kemnade was reestablished by the nuns from S. Peter's convent in Gehrden, it became a daughter-house of this convent and of Corvey, which asserted its right of protectorship over Kemnade. Kemnade did not hold the right of its own election of a provost (RÃ¶mer, 321). It is unclear whether every provost had direct connections to the abbey of Corvey. In the fifteenth century the provosts were primarily drawn from the secular nobility (RÃ¶mer, 321). From 1245 on the position of the provost gradually declined in power, as the convent with the support of Corvey acquired new income without the involvement of the provosts (RÃ¶mer, 322). ; The conventual church, built during the eleventh century, still exists, although it is currently only half the size it was in the Middle Ages. Originally the church had apses to the sides and a longer nave and ended in a west facade with towers (RÃ¶mer, 324-5). From the gothic period the church retains glass windows on the East side of the northern trancept. These depict Christ on the cross between Mary and John and the arisen Christ. A portion of an altar to Mary from the fifteenth century exists. Other artistic objects are still extant (see art/artifacts). One of the economic buildings remains today. ; The convent engaged in several prayer confraternities. It established prayer confraternities with the community in Lemego in 1310 and with the canons in Ohsen in 1320. In 1323 it established a prayer confraternity with S. Bonifatius in Hameln and in 1338 and 1340 with the Augustinian canonesses at Derneburg and WÃ¼lfinghausen respectively. It also established such a relationship with the Cistercian convent of Walkenried (RÃ¶mer, 303). The convent acted as patron of the parish church of S. Dionysius. The convent was also involved in the establishment and confirmation of a chapel to S. Nicholas in Bodenwerder (mentioned 1245). The convent exercised an indirect patronage over the churches of S. Nicolaus and S. Gertrud as well (RÃ¶mer, 323). ; The right of the protectorate over the convent was claimed by the nobles of Billungern and King Lothar of SÃ¼pplingenburg and after them, the Welfs. Because of this relationship, the community became involved in the later disputes between the Welf and Staufer families (RÃ¶mer, 299). The convent became administrated by ministerial managers. The lords of Homburg acted as patrons of the community, beginning during the thirteenth century. In fact, along with the Cistercian convent of Amelungsborn, the convent was the second proprietary monastery of the dynasty (RÃ¶mer, 301). The lords of Everstein, the chief competitors of the Homburg family on the region surrounding the Weser river, recognized the Homburg control of the convent and in 1197 they ceded their holdings and rights in the areas closely surrounding the convent and circa 1280 they did the same in Rene at Kemnade (RÃ¶mer, 301). In the fifteenth century the count of Pyrmont became more important in the convent's affairs (RÃ¶mer, 305). Beginning in 1004, when Heinrich II confirmed the refoundation of the convent, the protectorship over the convent functioned as an imperial grant and the German king functioned as the supreme protector of the convent (RÃ¶mer, 315). In 1147 Duke Henry the Lion granted the protectorship to the abbot of Corvey as a fief. The abbot held the protectorship independently of the abbey's provostship over the convent of Kemnade (RÃ¶mer, 315). In 1579 Duke Julius of Braunschweig-WolfenbÃ¼ttel reformed Kemnade according to Lutheran teachings (RÃ¶mer, 315). Beginning in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, members of the nobility purchased the right of advocacy for individual hides of land owned by Kemnade (RÃ¶mer, 316). ; Conversi are mentioned in the mid-thirteenth century. The convent also employed several priests under the provost.";FAUX

The community follwed the rule of the Third Order of Franciscans. The foundation gradually won more followers, and a church dedicated to S. John the Baptist and a new cloister were erected in 1388. After the death of the original founders, the community became Augustinian canonesses in 1394. After 1412, under prioress Anna Schmid, the community accepted strict enclosure. The canonesses obtained the priviledge of choosing their own confessor and had permission to receive the sacraments in their own chapel (Hindsley, 188). In 1431 the canonesses adopted the statutes ofÂ Pillenreuth. The adoption of these statutes may have led to the literary flowering of the community. They also led to the adoption of private cells for each sister. This change fostered the development of contemplation, while strict enclosure encouraged work in the scriptorium (Hindsley, 189). ; After the secularization of this community, the library holdings were either destroyed or dispersed. However, the extant works show that a great value must have been placed on the preservation of mystical texts from a variety of sources (Hindsley, 188).

The monastic scriptorium gained a reputation by producing fine missals and choir books. Inzigkoven's library contained amny mystical texts from the fourteenth century, copied by Anna JÃ¤ck and Elisabeth Muntprat. In 1498 Justina Blarer translated the lives of the Dutch leaders of the Devotio Moderna (Hindsley, 188). So far more that 30 manuscripts from the library of this community have been identified. Among them are texts from some of the greatest mystical writers of the late medieval period: Bonaventure, Rulman Mersswin, Pseudo-Bonaventure, Meister Eckhart, Gertrude the Great, Marquard of Lindau, Jan van Roesbroeck, Henry Suso, and John Tauler (Hindsley, 189). A collection of the manuscripts from Engelthal were included in a major manuscript (Sammelhardschrift) produced for the canonesses of Inzigkoven in the fifteenth century by Hans Probst. The manuscript includes Christina Ebner's Sister-book of Engelthal, the Revelations of Adelheid Langmann, the Gnaden-vita of Friedrich Sunder, and the Vita of Sister Gertrud of Engelthal by Conrard Friedrich and Heinrich of Engelthal (Hindsley, 189). A portion of this manuscript was written by Anna JÃ¤ck, a member of the community. Since the manuscript was both commissioned and partially produced at Inzigkoven, it likely reveals the mystical interests of the sisters. ; In 1431 the canonesses adopted the statutes ofÂ Pillenreuth. Thereafter their confessors came from the monasteries of Langenzenn and Indersdorf. The community had literary ties with the female communities ofÂ EngelthalÂ andÂ PillenreuthÂ as well.

In 1273 the abbot of Neustadt was recognized as the spiritual ""inspector"" of the convent. The convent had a provost who ranked above the abbess and convent. In 1221 the provost was also granted priestly duties.

In 1569 the archbishop of Mainz established the prioress Anna Geupel (a Benedictine)as the abbess of Himmelthal. This led to a long dispute between the bishop and the counts of Erbach. The abbess was for a decade the only inhabitant of the convent as the assumption of new members had been forbidden. She died in 1601. In 1568 the episcopate of Mainz dissolved the convent as it had already died out by this time (Krausen, 58). The income of the convent was later transferred to the Jesuits (Link, 592). ; more research necessary Hist.

Damiano Macra) in epoca precostantiniana e lo presenta come ecclesiastico ed evangelizzatore di Pedona.
All'inizio del sec. X, quando questa località fu devastata dai Saraceni, il corpo del santo fu portato a Quargnento, dove sulla sua tomba fu posta l'iscrizione: "" ic requiescit corpus sancti Dalmatii repositum ab Audace episcopo Astensi"".
In Francia, sin dal sec. IX, Dalmazio è considerato martire. Fonti più recenti lo dicono oriundo della Germania, evangelizzatore di molte città del Piemonte, dell'Emilia e della Gallia, ucciso per la fede nel 254. Il Martirologio Romano, fondandosi su liste episcopali manipolate, lo ricorda, a torto, il 5 dicembre, come vescovo di Pavia, dove, tuttavia, gli era dedicata una chiesa. Di certo si sa che a Pedona esisteva una basilica eretta in suo onore, e che il 5 dicembre molti pellegrini, provenienti anche da paesi lontani, convenivano al suo sepalcro. Probabilmente Dalmazio fu un evangelizzatore locale di Pedona, in un'epoca non facilmente determinabile, e perciò vi fu venerato come santo; il 5 dicembre sarebbe l'anniversario della sua morte, oppure della sua elevazione all'onore degli altari.

Hans provided the Beguines with a house and a farm, located between the old city wall and the ""animal-garden"" (Link, 614). The community stood on the present island in the SchÃ¶nthal. ; The city built a house for poor and sick pilgrims next to the Beguines' house. During the religious wars, the Beguines faced plunderers in search of the reported riches of the house.

The community presumably dissolved at this time. ; More research necessary ; Klosterbuch der Diocese Wurzburg. ; According to Link, the Beguines cared for the sick and for the altar of the neighboring ""Sandkapelle"" which served the spiritual needs of the community, and assisted in the mortuary and in funeral processions (Link, 614). ; On the present island in the SchÃ¶nthal of Aschaffenberg. ; Aschaffenberg ; The information about this community is rather sketchy and further verification is required. ; The major-domo of the electoral prince, Albert, named Kasper from Schulenberg, acted as patron and protector of the community.

However, the political and religious situation of the period prevented the full realization of Albert's plans, and the windows for the five altars had to be sold to cover some of the debts of the prince. ; According to Link, (circa 1873) the cellar steps of this former Beguine house were still visible. Foundation and Context:

Later Foundation: Unlike many of the very early medieval foundations, the Klarissenkloster in Aschaffenburg was established in the early 17th century, around 1620 (some sources may vary slightly). This places its origin during the Catholic Counter-Reformation period and just before or during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War.
Aschaffenburg: A significant town in Lower Franconia (Bavaria today), historically a secondary residence of the Archbishops and Electors of Mainz. Their presence and patronage were crucial for the Catholic life of the city.
Patronage: The foundation was likely initiated or strongly supported by the ruling Archbishop of Mainz, as part of efforts to strengthen Catholic piety and institutions.
Name: It would have been officially known as Kloster St. Klara or similar. The term ""Klosterle"" would have been a local, possibly affectionate or descriptive, nickname.
Franciscan Connection: As always, the Poor Clares would have had a close relationship with the Franciscan friars in Aschaffenburg (who had a presence there from the 13th century), who would have provided spiritual direction, Mass, and sacraments.
Life of the Clarisse Nuns (Rooted in the Rule of St. Clare):
Even though founded post-medievally, their life was based on the timeless Rule of St. Clare:

Contemplative Prayer: The central focus, with the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office) structuring their day and night, daily Mass, and periods of mental prayer and meditation.
Strict Poverty: Renunciation of personal and communal property, relying on alms and the work of their own hands.
Enclosure (Cloister): A strictly enclosed life within the monastery walls to foster an environment of prayer and detachment.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess, sharing all things in common.
Manual Labor:
Spinning, weaving, needlework (including liturgical embroidery, ""Paramentenstickerei"").
Gardening within their cloister.
Baking, and other domestic tasks.
Language: Liturgical Latin, with everyday spoken language being German.
Significance and Interaction with Aschaffenburg:

Counter-Reformation Role: Its foundation in the 17th century would have been part of the broader Catholic efforts to renew and reinforce faith in response to the Protestant Reformation.
Spiritual Support: The nuns prayed for the city, its rulers (the Archbishops of Mainz), and its inhabitants.
Local Vocations: It would have attracted women from Aschaffenburg and the surrounding region.
Challenges:

Thirty Years' War (1618-1648): If founded around 1620, the monastery would have experienced the immense disruptions and hardships of this devastating war, which heavily impacted German lands. Aschaffenburg itself was occupied at times.
Later wars and political changes in the region.
Dissolution:

The monastery existed for nearly two centuries.
It was dissolved in 1803 during the widespread Secularization in Bavaria (and other German states under Napoleonic influence). Church properties, including monasteries, were confiscated by the state.
The nuns were dispersed, and the monastery buildings were repurposed. Sources mention the buildings were used for various purposes, including as a hospital or for housing, before eventually being demolished or significantly altered.
In summary, the ""Klosterle"" of the Poor Clares in Aschaffenburg was a 17th-century foundation, living according to the traditional, medieval-rooted Rule of St. Clare. It served as a center of contemplative prayer and Catholic piety under the patronage of the Archbishops of Mainz until its dissolution in the early 19th century. The term ""Klosterle"" likely reflected its size or the local community's perception of it.";FAUX

According to this account, the two women used their own property along with alms to found the convent. (The first donation was a little lamb that gave birth to the community's entire herd.)

The foundation was originally for canonesses. As a result of the reform movement in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the community changed to a Benedictine convent and assumed the Benedictine Rule (Riggert). 1255 is the first mention of the community living under the Benedictine Rule. ; In 1482 the convent undertook an internal reform at the instigation of Duchess Anna von Nassau and with the help of the convent ofÂ Ebstorf. Circa 1522 the Lutheran reform was established under the influence of the Welfs. Duke Ernst of Brunswick tried to impose the Lutheran reform on the convent. In response, the nuns locked the convent door and took refuge in the choir of the chapel. Duke Ernst first pleaded with the nuns, then forcibly opened the gates and had a hole bashed in the choir for his Proestant preachers to speak through!(Wiesner-Hanks, 16). The community suffered under the Napoleonic era. On October 16, 1811, it was occupied by M. de Boeuf and in February of 1812 the convent was dissolved. By May, the women were forced to leave; a few renting rooms in the convent were allowed to stay.

The former Commandery, a medieval monastery of the Knights Hospitaller, is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.


Ritterhaus Bubikon
History
Assumably in compensation of claims related to the Alt-Rapperswil lands and rights, a change of goods occurred between the Counts of Toggenburg and Counts of Rapperswil probably in the early 1190s. To end the disputes about the legacy, the Knights Hospitaller abbey and commandry was given by Diethelm V von Toggenburg and Vogt Rudolf von Rapperswil between 1191 and 1198 AD. Although in concurrency to the neighbouring Rüti Abbey, the commandery's lands and goods grew with donations by local noble families during the 13th and 14th centuries – at the height of their power, the commandry owned land all over the present canton of Zürich.

so-called Bubikerhaus of the convent in Rapperswil, adjacent to the Brenyhaus nearby the Rapperswil Castle
The commandry's inhabitants was granted Burgrecht by the neighbouring town of Rapperswil,[2][3] later by the city of Zürich. During the Reformation in Zürich and the riots in the Herrschaft Grüningen against the feudal owners of the lands cultivated by the farmers and their families, Johannes Stumpf, the prior of the commandry at the time, supported its secularization and those of the neighbouring Rüti Abbey in spring 1525. The lands partially became the property of the city of Zürich when the convent was secularized in 1528 (convent) respectively 1798 (commandry).[4]

The buildings of the commandry were completely renewed in 1947, and the chapel between 1993 and 1995. In 2000 the museum was redesigned, and a herbal garden (German: Epochen-Kräutergarten) was established and the exterior partially renewed in 2011.[1] The adjacent farm and barn buildings are excluded from the Ritterhaus building complex, as they still are used as a privately cultivated farm.

The Ritterhaus building complex consists of the commander's house, the rectory, the Schütte and Sennhaus buildings, the so-called Bruderhaus being the oldest building, the 12th-century chapel of St. John the Baptist (dated 1192 AD), as well as the adjacent farm and economic buildings. The brothers’ house (Bruderhaus) and the chapel are the oldest buildings of the commandery and were probably built in the early 1190s, assumably incorporating an older building (maybe a chapel) that was built by the Toggenburg family. The 14th-century Romanesque nave of the chapel was expanded by a Gothic chancel that was destroyed in 1819. The remains of Romanesque mural paintings date back to the first half of the 13th century. They illustrate the foundation of the commonly named Ritterhaus building complex by the Toggenburg and Rapperswil families, and display scenes of the live of Saint John the Baptist. The chapel was desecrated and secularised during the Reformation in Zürich. The main building (Haupthaus), serving as the commander's house and administration complex, and the adjacent wing (Ritterhausflügel) were added between the 13th and 15th century; after the Reformation it was the seat of the local governor, a city council member from Zürich. The representative rooms were used for official purposes, and therefore richly decorated in the Renaissance style in 1570. At the same time, the coats of arms of the Knights of Malta was painted onto the façade towards the courtyard. The servants' house (Sennhaus, Gesindehaus) was built around 1480 and rebuilt in 1570 for the purpose of the production of cheese.[5]";

Unfortunately, no early documents reveal the extent of the community's property. The first mention of the economic history of the convent stems from thirteenth-century documents. The principal holding of the community was a farm in Bassum with about 200 fields. A building inventory from 1583 described this property as an outlying estate with horsestalls and pig styes as well as a bake house and brew house (Asch, 51). The convent also had a water mill nearby. The convent also held other hides which were worked by serfs. In 1321 the serfs were burdened so greatly that they were unable to help with the restoration of the cloister and the abbess had to sell their additional properties in BettingbÃ¼hren. The properties were divided into main farms with dependent fields worked by serfs and outlying properties. Most of the properties appear to have been located within the parish of Bassum. One outlying complex lay in Apelstedt and included forest rights (Asch, 52). In 1211 Count Moritz of Oldenburg sold his farm in Nienstedt to the convent with hides and houses in various neighboring villages as part of the entrance of his daughter into the convent. In 1403 the convent alienated its property in GadesbÃ¼nden to the dukes of Klencke for life; the need for help from Duke Henry of Braunschweig and LÃ¼neburg in 1503 ensured resulted in the convent's permanent loss of this holding (Asch, 52). In 1295 Count Hildebold of Oldenburg mortgaged to the convent several farms in Ochtum, Lowe, and Gr. Henstedt. The convent agreed to perform masses and vigils for his soul in return. This may also have served as remuneration for his daughter, who dwelt in the convent (Asch, 52). The community held the rights of patronage over the parish in Bassum, but this appears to have been the only one. After the Reformation, Bassum held lower jurisdictional rights in certain areas, although it is unclear whether its jurisdictional rights existed in the medieval period as well (Asch, 55). Quite early on, perhaps in the thirteenth century, the abbess's property was separated from the conventual property, although it is unclear when the abbess began to occupy her own house (Asch, 56-7). ; The convent appears to have been quite well endowed. From the thirteenth century, documents reflect numerous and generous gifts of landed property, rights of advocacy, tithes, tolls, hides, and houses from the neighboring high and low nobility, particularly the counts of Oldenburg. The convent relied on its agricultural holdings, worked by serfs, as well as tithes. From 1270 on documents refer to financial problems, gifts, and grants of indulgences, which likely stem from the costs of the construction of a new church in the thirteenth century. ; The primary activity of the women in Bassum was their liturgical duties, but they also undertook the education of daughters of the surrounding nobility. As in many other female houses, the women of Bassum engaged in handiwork, but none of the embroidered clothes remain. According to Asch, the women spun, wove, and dyed their own clothes. The convent also had an infirmary, which Asch believes was open to more than just the women of the community (Asch, 56). ; In 1376 Abbess Gisela asked for clarification over the rights of her subjects, which she placed in three social categories: serfs, additional subjects, and those belonging to the convent (Dienstleuten (denstlude), Sonderleuten (sunderlude), and Gotteshausleuten (godeshuseslude)). The judgement returned was that the additional subjectes (Sonderleuten) were less free than those belonging to the convent (Gotteshausleuten). After their death, they must give half of their goods to their overlord (the convent) versus the ""Gotteshausleuten,"" who were required only to turn over their best piece of clothing or best cow. Serfs (Dienstleuten) were responsible for performing certain services to the convent. (Asch, 54).";"14517 ; Bircsinun (937), Birsina (937), Birchisinun (973), Birxinon (1074-1076), Byrsen (1158), Bersen, Brixina (1244) ; The community was founded by the archbishop of Hamburg, Anskar, a few years before his death in 865. The foundation initially consisted of canonesses. According to Adam of Bremen, this was the third new foundation of canons/canonnesses by the archbishop (Asch, 43). The foundation was made on property dedicated by the matron Luitgart for the support of a group of religious women under her direction. According to Heineken, this was the only case in ninth-century Saxony where a bishop established a nunnery within his diocese without his own property serving as the basis for the community (6). The documents suggest in other areas that the bishop was perhaps not directly involved in the establishment of the community (6). The means to found the community came likely in large part from the properties of a noble family (Liutgart's?), as well as from goods which Louis the Pious had given to the Bremen church for pious purposes. The convent was sited close to traffic and trade centers and served as a parish church as well. Although no parish church is mentioned prior to the foundation of this community of canonnesses, Asch finds it likely that one existed (Asch, 44). The original rule and lifestyle of this community is unknown; it is unclear whether this community lived according to the Aachen rule for canonnesses. It does appear that the community adopted the freer lifestyle of canonnesses, as a document from 1069 refers to a lady Gisla, dwelling in Bassum, as a ""canonica."" The first written mention of the community dates from a document of Otto I (in 937) which granted immunities to Bassum and other communities that belonged to the church in Hamburg. Bassum also appears among the other four communities founded by Ansgarin charters confirming priviledges issued by Otto II (967), Otto III (988), Henry II (1003, 1014), and Fredrick I (1158) (Asch, 44-45). A definite switch to the Benedictine rule occurred under the influence of the Cluniac reform movement and under the direction of Abbess Beatrix, countess of Oldenburg, who served as abbess from 1207-1224. (Her brother, Gerhard was Bishop of OsnabrÃ¼ck and Bishop of Bremen). At this time, strict enclosure was imposed on the women and private property was abolished. By 1290 a papal document of Nicholaus IV referred to the convent as belonging to the Benedictine Order. Nevertheless, F. Bestmann (in his two works on the convent of Bassum) denies that the community ever became a true Benedictine convent. Although he thinks that the community strived towards this goal, he believes it was never truly achieved. He contends that the community remained in practice a house of canonesses; Asch, however, is more inclined to view the conversion to the Benedictine lifestyle successful, citing the number of visitations the community received (Asch, 47). A document from 1417 further reveals that the nuns could not freely leave the convent except in cases where age and infirmity prevented them from performing their daily tasks (Asch, 49). ; The convent also had altars dedicated to Saints Alexius, Anne, Anscharius, Benedict, the holy cross, George, Hieronimus, John, Jodocus, Mary, Maritius, Mary Magdalene, Peter and Paul, and Victor. Despite the community's adoption of the Benedictine ruler, the four positions for canons in the community remained. In 1427 and 1517 differentiations were also made in documents between ""sorores professae"" (those who had taken vows under the Benedictine rule) and ""sorores non professae"" (those who had not). It seems likely that the convent continued to retain some elements of the freer lifestyle of canonesses (Asch, 47). In 1350 the county of Hoya was plundered by armies from Bremen in a dispute, leaving neither churches nor convents unharmed. In 1538 the Protestant Reformation was introduced into the community, although it was not firmly established until 1541 and the death of Abbess Anna Frese. Her successor, Margaretha von Hoya, was instrumental in the conversion of the community. The duke decided to permit the community to continue to function as a ""free noble chapter"" for daughters of the nobility. In the Post-Reformation period, the community continued to function much as it had. Women of the community were required to remain within the community, being permitted to leave for two eight-day periods within the year; they were forbidden from singing ""worldly"" songs, and the prioress was required to close the community's door by nine at night. The women were to have prayer books and orderly clothing, and they should remain chaste. They were permitted to live in their own homes within the conventual wall (Asch, 50). In 1582 with the death of the count of Hoya, the community came under the influence of the Welf (Guelph) house. As of 1908 the convent continued to function as a noble women's chapter. ; According to the 1450 Chronicom Bremense by Heinrich Wolters, Bishop Adaldag (d. 988) gave the convent the bones of Saint Victor as a gift. It is questionable whether S. Victor and S. Mauritius were revered in the convent from its beginning. However, by 1275, S. Moritz and S. Victor's days were celebrated particularly by the convent. In 1161 the convent received relics of S. Benedict and his sister, Scholastica. ; In 1376 Abbess Gisela asked for clarification over the rights of her subjects, which she placed in three social categories: serfs, additional subjects, and those belonging to the convent (Dienstleuten (denstlude), Sonderleuten (sunderlude), and Gotteshausleuten (godeshuseslude)). The judgement returned was that the additional subjectes (Sonderleuten) were less free than those belonging to the convent (Gotteshausleuten). After their death, they must give half of their goods to their overlord (the convent) versus the ""Gotteshausleuten,"" who were required only to turn over their best piece of clothing or best cow. Serfs (Dienstleuten) were responsible for performing certain services to the convent.

Abbess Beatrix, countess of Oldenburg, (1207-1224) was responsible for imposing the Benedictine rule on the community. Under Abbess Anna Frese (d. 1541), a member of the noble Hoya family and the last Catholic abbess, the community experienced an intensive religious renewal. She established a spiritual confraternity with the female Cistercian convent ofÂ GravenhorstÂ in Tecklenburg (Asch, 47). She further sympathized with the movement of the Bursfeld Congregation. Abbess Margaretha von Hoya, the successor of Anna Frese, was instrumental in converting the community to Lutheranism. She was the oldest daughter of the ruling duke of Hoya, and in 1549 she left the community to marry. ; Despite visitations and attempts to impose the Benedictine rule, records from this community indicate that the canonesses retained private income and property definitely into the eleventh century. Later records (one from the fifteenth century) refer to the women being able to dispose of their private income by a last will and testament. A large portion of the convent's income came from tithes. In 1583 farmers from approximately 30 villages contributed oats and rye (Asch, 52). ; Benedictine ; Members of the community were presumably drawn from the nobility. Many abbesses of the community came from the relatives of the archbishop of Bremen and from the noble house of Oldenburg (during their period as lay advocates). ; In 1231 the number of women was limited to 50. F. Bestmann believes that this number was limited to an abbess, prioress, 10 canonesses, and 38 students. The limit of 50 sisters (sorores) may also refer to an attempt to convert this community into a regular Benedictine convent. In 1211 a document refers to 10 virgins by name as well as ""aliores sorores."" Asch believes that the convent could not maintain a number of 50 inhabitants in later periods due to competition from the emergence of numberous other female houses. In 1482 the prioress, 11 nuns, and 4 canonesses elected the new abbess, Anna Frese. In 1517 the names of 16 inhabitants of the convent (excluding the abbess and prioress) are known(Asch, 56). ; near Dipeholz; in the diocese of OsnabrÃ¼ck ; Largau; in the dukedom of Saxony; in the archdiocese of Bremen. ; The spiritual level of the community seemed to decline in the second half of the twelfth century, causing the archbishop of Bremen to make a visitation in 1185. In this year the provost, Thietmar von NeumÃ¼nster and archbishop Adalbero, visited the convent and placed the canonesses under a stricter rule of enclosure; contrary canonesses were sent away. Under Archbishop Hartwich (1148-1168), whose sister was elected abbess of Bassum in 1151, the spirit of Cluny entered the community (Asch, 45-46). In 1211 the convent received another visitation from the reform-minded Gerhard, bishop of Bremen, in order to establish the Benedictine rule, with a common dormitory, strict enclosure and the abolishment of all private property, upon the community. Another visitation was made in 1321. In 1287 the Archbishop threatened Abbess Beatrix with the bann unless the community's faults were remedied. ; Nothing is known about the earliest church and conventual buildings; they were likely built of wood. No archaeological work has been undertaken on the site. It is assumed that the first stone basilica construction was begun under Abbess Beatrix before 1220, on the basis of stylistic comparisons to Marienfeld. The choir belongs to this earliest building period. A second building period occurred circa 1230, which apparently intended to create a three-nave, cruciform basilica structure with a ""Westwerk"" that included two towers. Circa 1260-1270 a third building phase ensued, changing the structure from a basilica to a hall structure with three naves (Asch, 58). The church was constructed in a style reflective of both Romaneque and Gothic styles. The roof was completed in the thirteenth century. These building projects apparently caused the community some financial difficulties. Little reference is made to the conventual buildings and outbuildings, which are no longer extant. In 1240 mention is made of the refectory. A document of 1321 records the rebuilding of the cloister walkway; another refers to lights needed in the infirmary (1207); another document of 1376 refers to the ""Kemenade,"" a heated house of stone within the abbey (Asch, 58). A seventeenth-century plan appears to depict remains of the cloister to the south of the church. In 1327-28 a fire destroyed most of the conventual buildings and a good part of the church. The western towers of the church suffered so much damage that they were not rebuilt. The costly rebuilding continued until 1351. An inventory of 1583 mentions 7 small apartments under one roof (presumably the old dormitory divided into separate rooms)within the community's walls, where the women resided. ; Little of the interior decoration of the church remains, although restoration work in the 1960s revealed an altar with a reliquary and shrine in wood, whose gold decoration had been previously robbed. The shrine dates to circa 1150 and is presumed to hold the relics of S. Victor. His altar is refered to in documents dating to 1380 as being in the women's choir. The convent used two seals. The earlier of the two depicts S. Victor in knightly armor with a helmut and lance, a shield with a cross before him, and left a banner, reading: Tenemus ecce [arma], i.e. ""Behold we hold weapons in order to avoid fighting."" The more recent seal is round and depicts both patrons under a baldachin with two steeples between three pillars. On the right stands S. Mauritius, on the left S. Victor with sword and a shield with a cross. Around the edge it says: Sigillum conventus in Bersen. In addition, a seal of Abbess Salome from 1244 and another from Abbess Gisela from 1373 are extant (Asch, 61). ; In the documents the women of this houses are variously refered to as: dominae, sorores, moniales, sanctimoniales, conclaustrales, sorores professae and non professae. As in many other female houses, the women of Bassum engaged in handy-work, but none of the embroidered clothes remain. In 1276 there is a reference to a chamberlain, who supervised the clothing and important possessions of the convent. In 1337 mention is made of a sexton, who cared for the altar and liturgy (Asch, 57). ; No references to the library or works found in Bassum exists. Apart from one page of the fifteenth-century Missal, now located among the community's archives, none of the works owned by the community are extant. ; Bassum received most of its landed possessions through donations made by neighboring noble families, particularly the families of Oldenburg and Hoya. The counts von Hoya acted as advocates of the community in the late Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, the convent supposedly chose the Count of Rhoden as its advocate (Asch, 55). ; The noblewoman, Liutgart, provided the means for the foundation and became the community's first abbess. ; The thirteenth-century church still exists, but the medieval conventual and out-buildings no longer remain. Renovation work undertaken in 1866 altered the church and remaining cloister buildings considerably. All the remaining conventual buildings are Post-Reformation. ; The community maintained close ties with the archbishops of Bremen, particularly from the fourteenth century. In fact, the convent was subordinate to the archbishop of Bremen in spiritual matters. The archbishop had the right to bestow the advocacy for this community on neighboring noble families as a fief. In the fifteenth century, the convent had close ties to female Cistercian houses, such asÂ GravenhorstÂ (Asch, 47). In 1410 the Provincial of the Friars Minor in Saxony accepted the convent into its spiritual fraternity (Asch, 49). ; Lay advocates for the community were drawn from the families of the counts of Rhoden (Wunstorf), Oldenburg-Bruchhausen (since 1207), and von Hoya (since the fourteenth century). As advocates of the convent, the counts of Hoya took over the jurisdiction of the convent and its subjects. The convent employed local advocates for its outlying properties (Asch, 55). In 1417 Count Otto von Hoya renounced his protectorate over five farms of the convent in Hassel, Nienhaus, Nienstedt, Kollage, Borstel and took the convent into his protection (Asch, 52). A little is known of the social level of the convent's subjects, who appear as witnesses in the documents. Among the highest levels appear members of ministerial families and knights. They presumably held the position of lower nobility and their number was restricted to approximately five. They were responsible for overseeing the security and order of the convent (Asch, 52-3). Around the turn of the fifteenth century, these families appear to have transformed into ministerial families in Bremen and other cities, where the opportunities for advancement were greater. Another important position was the procurator curie, the administrator of the convent's properties. ; The convent employed three priests and a subdeacon, who were primarily responsible for performing the mass. In 1317 the Bremen cathedral chapter permitted the abbess to bestow the four with their benefices, provided they were presented to the provost of BÃ¼cken, who instructed them in their care for souls. In 1244 the archbishop of Bremen referred to them as secular canons. In 1520 Abbess Anna Frese differentiated between priest who resided in the church and those who did not (Asch, 57).";FAUX

The convent was already established and had moved to Bergedorf at this time, although there is a reference to the time when it lay in Bremen by S. Michael (Hofmeister, 62). According to tradition, the convent was founded by Count Moritz I von Oldenburg and his mother, Kunigunde, on the site of the murder of his brother, Count Christian von Oldenburg. (Christian was murdered on his return from a crusade in Palestine circa 1192). Count Moritz moved the nuns from Bremen to the new site of Bergedorf. The convent was placed under the archbishop of Bremen (Hofmeister, 63). It is also unclear when the nuns were replaced by Cistercian monks from the monastery of Marienthal by Helmstedt. This may have occurred any time between the death of Moritz circa 1217 and the entrance of the Aboot Konrad von Rastede, circa 1226. According to Hoogeweg, the monks settled here circa 1231. ; Only two documents from the nunnery survive: an original in the Huder Klosterarchiv, the other is a handwritten copy from the Wilhadistfites in Bremen from the fourteenth century.

The convent received many rich gifts, for which the intercession of the convent (on behalf of the patrons) was taken for granted (Heineken, 75).;"4210 ; There is much controversy about the history of the foundation of Herford. Much of the debate revolves around the accuracy of the Vita Waltgeri, dating to the early thirteenth century. The foundation of this convent dates back to the missionary phase of German Christianization (Lobbedey, 335). According to Schmitz-Kallenberg, tradition states that the convent was founded circa 789 in the district of Bielefeld by Waltger, and in 819 the convent moved to Herford. The most accepted view is that the convent was founded by Adelhard and Wala, along with Corvey, based on the example of Marienkloster at Soissons. In contrast, some scholars accept the accuracy of the Vita Waltgeri, which relates that a Saxon noble established the convent in Herford after two failed attempts at MÃ¼dehorst and Altenherford (Lobbedey, 335). According to the Vita, the noble had the relics of S. Oswald brought to the convent from England. When he heard of the foundation of Corvey, the founder of Herford reputedly went to Louis the Pious and placed the convent of Herford under his care (Lobbedey, 335). For Corvey the Benedictine rule is mentioned but not for Herford. No mention is made of the election of abbesses for the community either. Because Herford is said to have been founded on the model of Corvey, it is possible that the community followed the Benedictine rule, but definite confirmation is lacking (Heineken, 98-99). ; The community was a house of Augustinian canonesses according to Hilpisch; however, most sources refer to the house as Benedictine. At the time of the Reformation, the convent converted to Lutheranism and became a secular women's chapter. ; The convent held the relics of the S.

Pusinna, the abbess of Herford was the sister of Count Cobbo. ; The administration of the property of the convent was not granted to the abbess of Herford; jurisdictional rights were likwise never granted to the abbess alone. The abbot of Corvey acted as the overseer for the convent (Heineken, 76). The relationship between Corvey and Herford was very close during the ninth and tenth centuries (Lobbedey, 335). Herford also had close ties to the convent of Mary (Marienkloster) at Soissons, where a sister of Adalhard and Wala, Theodrada, was abbess from circa 810-846. ; Herford was an imperial chapter. The history of Herford is closely tied to that of the Carolingians. Nevertheless, no imperial diplomas record Louis the Pious as the actual founder of the convent (Lobbedey, 336).";FAUX

Once inside, the men offered to find the nuns husbands and tried to kiss them.

Sister Eva reported that the nuns attempted to restrict the ability of the lay congregation to see them by slinking down into their seats during religious services and pulling their veils low. The locks were also taken off of the convent's doors, which according to Neyler's account, allowed men to enter the convent and proposition the nuns. ; A reform account from the sixteenth century, written by Sister Eva Neyler, survives from this community.

Penitents at Pforzheim = the German “Sackbrüder / Brüder von der Buße”, i.e. the male branch of the short-lived Order of Penance of Jesus Christ (Latin: Ordo poenitentiae Iesu Christi).  They wore an undyed sack-cloth habit and lived from begging; most of their houses existed for barely 15–20 years (c. 1255-1276) until the Council of Lyon suppressed the order.

There is no documentary trace of a **female** Penitent house at Pforzheim, only of the tiny **male** friary outlined below.

1.  Name and corporate patron
──────────────────────────────────────────────
medieval Latin:  fratres de poenitentia Iesu Christi de Phorzheim  
vernacular:      die Sackbrüder zu Pforzheim  
universal patron:  Jesus Christ under the mystery of Penance  
local church dedication: the surviving deeds call the convent “ecclesia Sanctae Mariae Magdalenae”, so the house, like many Sack-friaries, kept St Mary Magdalene as its titular saint.

2.  Chronology in four lines
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• 1259-1261 First appearance in a charter of Margrave Rudolf I of Baden giving the friars a strip of land “extra muros versus Enzam” (outside the eastern town ditch near the river Enz).  
• 1263-1273 Scattered wills (e.g. Bürger Ulrich der Schreiber, 1266) leave bread or small cash gifts; the only known community officers are a prior “frater Heinrich” (attested 1270) and a lector “frater Konrad” (1272).  Numbers were probably < 12.  
• 1274 Second Council of Lyon abolishes the order.  Bishop Friedrich of Speyer received the Pforzheim friars’ formal act of renunciation on 12 Feb 1276.  
• 1277-1281 The deserted site (“ubi quondam habitaverunt fratres de sacco”) is transferred to the hospital of the Holy Spirit; church turned into a hospital chapel, conventual buildings dismantled for timber.  After 1400 even the toponym disappears from rentals.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Physical setting (reconstructed)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
– Strip between the east town wall and the Enz ford, c. 50 m × 30 m.  
– Small single-nave church (≈ 18 × 7 m) with wooden bell-cote; south of it a cloister court edged by timber-frame dormitory and refectory.  
– No above-ground remains: the area lies under today’s “Östliche Karl-Friedrich-Strasse / Altstädter Kirche” car-park.  Trial trenches in 1985 hit flint-and-mortar footings, pottery of 13th-c. cooking wares and an iron strap-hinge—probably sack-friar debris but not conclusively proved.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Economy and daily life (thin evidence)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Income**:  purely mendicant.  The friars had no rents; the margrave’s charter granted only usufruct of a garden and the right to collect alms inside Pforzheim two days a week (Friday and Sunday).  
• **Activities**:  fast-day preaching and intercessory prayer for donors are mentioned in two wills; no school or hospital service is recorded.  
• **Size**:  most German Sack-houses mustered 6-10 men; Pforzheim’s fragmentary necrology lists eight names in all (one prior, one lector, six “fratres”).  
• **Relations**:  peaceful coexistence with the Dominican friary across the Enz; a joint procession on the feast of St Mary Magdalene (22 July) is attested 1271.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Dissolution and after-use
──────────────────────────────────────────────
When they accepted suppression (Feb 1276) the friars swore obedience to the bishop; four took the Augustinian Hermit habit at nearby Stuttgart, two returned to lay life, two disappear from record.  
The site, absorbed by the **Heilig-Geist-Spital** (Holy-Spirit hospital), served as its garden and subsequently for warehouse sheds; nothing of the Penitent convent survived the town fires of 1370 and 1645.

Here's what's known about it:

Location: The monastery was situated in the Borgo di Mortara, one of the historic districts or suburbs just outside the main city walls of Novara. ""Borgo"" often referred to a settlement that grew up around a city gate or along a major road leading from the city.
Monastery Name: The community was known as the Monastery of Santa Chiara (Saint Clare).
Period: The Monastery of Santa Chiara in Borgo Mortara was founded in the mid-13th century, specifically around 1252-1253, very shortly after the death of Saint Clare of Assisi herself (1253). This rapid establishment reflects the quick spread and popularity of the Franciscan movement and its female branch, the Poor Clares, throughout Italy in that era. It was firmly established and active throughout the later medieval period.
Nature of the Community: They were Poor Clares, following the Rule of Saint Clare. This meant they were a strictly cloistered (enclosed) community of nuns dedicated to a life of prayer, penance, and radical poverty, inspired by Saint Francis and Saint Clare.
Activities of the Clares Community in Borgo Mortara, Novara in Medieval Times:

The life and activities of the nuns at Santa Chiara in Borgo Mortara were characteristic of enclosed female monastic communities of the Poor Clares during the Middle Ages:

Spiritual and Liturgical Life:

Divine Office: Their central activity was the communal recitation or chanting of the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) at set times throughout the day and night.
Prayer and Contemplation: Extensive time was dedicated to personal prayer, meditation, and contemplation within the confines of the monastery.
Mass: Participation in Mass celebrated by a chaplain (usually a Franciscan friar or other approved priest) in their chapel, separate from the public.
Adherence to the Rule: Living strictly according to the Rule of Saint Clare, emphasizing spiritual discipline and union with God.
Strict Enclosure (Claustrum):

The nuns lived behind strict walls and grills, with minimal contact with the outside world. Visitors could only speak to them through a grate. This was a defining feature of the Poor Clares.
Poverty and Manual Labor:

Following the Franciscan ideal, they embraced poverty, owning little collectively and nothing individually.
They supported themselves through manual labor performed within the cloister. Common activities included:
Fine Needlework: Sewing and embroidering liturgical vestments, altar cloths, and other textiles for the monastery and sometimes for sale.
Making Objects of Devotion: Creating rosaries, small devotional images, etc.
Gardening: Growing food for their own consumption if the monastery had space.
Copying Manuscripts: Although less common than in male monasteries or some other female orders, some literate nuns might have copied religious texts.
Economic Sustenance:

Despite their vow of poverty, convents needed means to survive. They relied on:
Dowries: Wealthy families often provided a ""dowry"" of money or property when a daughter entered the convent.
Donations and Alms: Receiving charitable contributions from the faithful, local nobility, merchants, and especially from the associated Franciscan friars.
Cultural and Social Connection (Indirect):

While enclosed, the convent was part of the city's religious landscape.
Nuns often came from prominent Novarese families, maintaining indirect social connections through their families and patrons.
The community offered spiritual intercession (prayers) for the city and its benefactors.
They were under the spiritual guidance and jurisdiction of the Franciscan friars.
In summary, the Monastery of Santa Chiara in Borgo Mortara was a key part of medieval Novara's religious life. The Poor Clares community there dedicated themselves to a rigorous life of prayer, poverty, and enclosure, supporting themselves through manual labor and donations, and serving as a spiritual heart within their district of the city.";FAUX

The convent then purchased (rights?) in the villages of Honstede, Dalem, Krempel, and rights to tithes in Wenekenbutle (Schulze, 437). By 1280 the provost of the convent had at his disposal taxes from the villages of HolÃŸel, Esingstedt and Sorthum. With the convent's transfer to Altenwalde in 1282 came new acquisitions in the villages of Northum and Walle. The convent grew in land possessions and tithes from Gudendorf, Oxstedt, Berensch, Arensch, Holte and Spangen (Schulze, 437). When the convent was transferred to Wolde, the chapels of the Holy Cross and S. Willehad were placed at the disposal of the convent. These chapels served as pilgrimage sites. The convent also received a third of the income from the parish church. The convent owned a mill in Neuenwalde. The convent acquired goods and tithes from the holdings of the knights of Bederkesa and their vassals and also purchased other lands. In 1389 the convent acquired the rights to construct a brickworks from the knights of Elm (Schulze, 432). ; Following disputes between the nobles and peasantry in this area over rights to fields and woods, the convent grew more impoverished. The charter of transfer stated that the nuns suffered from poverty in 1282. The convent's transfer to Altenwalde and connection to the pilgrimage church of the Holy Cross undoubtedly was intended to place the convent in a better financial position (Schulze, 437). The convent's transfer to Neuenwalde circa 1334 appears to have been economically profitable, and the fourteenth century probably was the most profitable in the convent's history. At this time the convent's possessions and rights reached southwards towards Sievern, Wehden, Spaden and Lehe. The convent acquired goods and tithes from the holdings of the knights of Bederkesa and their vassals. However, in 1428, when Archbishop Nikolaus of Bremen issued another privilege for the convent, the nuns were again described as poor. According to Schulze, it appears as if during the fifteenth century, the convent was systematically ""robbed"" of its possessions and dependents (Schulze, 432). In 1499/1500 all the convent buildings were destroyed and burned. ; In the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the convent may have provided loans for the peasantry in return for regular rents, but records of definite possessions are lacking from this period (Schulze, 438).";"10947 ; Midlum (1219); Middelheim (1231); Meddelem (1282); Altenwalde; monasterium sancte Crucis in Wolde (1334); Heiliges Kreuzes auf dem Berge; Oldenwolde (1356); Nigenwolde (1334); Nyenwolde (1337); Nigenwolde; Neuwalde; Marienkloster ; In 1219 the nobles from Diepholz conveyed their property in and around Midlum to the chapel of the Bremen church with the stipulation that a nunnery should be established there. The six donors were the sons of Wilhelm I and Gottschalk I of Diepholz. Wilhelm's sons were both religious figures, Wilhelm II was the canon in Minden and Konrad II a canon in Halberstadt (Schulze, 429). Gottschalk's son, Johann, was a canon in Bremen. Unfortunately, shortly after the decision to establish this convent was made, a dispute errupted between the bishops of Bremen and Hamburg. The dispute hindered the establishment of the convent, which may not have occurred until as late as 1227 (Schulze, 430). The convent was confirmed in 1232 by Archbishop Gerhard and King Friedrich II. The confirmation charter records the nuns as belonging to the Cistercian order. However, it is the only time that the convent is recorded as Cistercian. The foundation belonged to the Premonstratensian order, according to Hoogeweg (Hoogeweg, 96). From 1282 on, the convent is referred to as Benedictine. In January of 1282 the convent was transferred from Midlum to Wolde, present Altenwalde, and it is possible that a change in order occurred at this time. It is also possible that the convent followed Cistercian customs without formal incorporation. The charter of transfer stated that the nuns suffered from poverty and lived without a secure and regulated supervision in the midst of unruly peasants (Schulze, 431). The charter of transfer dates from January 1282. In August, Bishop Giselbert placed the nuns in their new community, and on September 20 he celebrated the consecration of the church and cloister there. The convent's transfer was combined with a reform of conventual life. Fifty years later, the convent was transferred again by the provost of Altenwalde. Again, he complained of the poverty of the convent in fields, wood, mills, and water, as well as the age and poor condition of the buildings. In 1334 the archbishop gave permission for the convent to transfer to Neuenwalde, where the provost had already established a mill (Schulze, 431). The convent may have returned to Altenwalde. Certainly the relic of the holy cross was returned to Altenwalde, because the pilgrimage to Altenwalde resumed. In 1400 Archbishop Otto of Bremen granted a privilege that authorized the transfer to the parish church and granted an indulgence of forty days to all who aided with the new construction (Schulze, 432). However, further mention of this transfer is lacking. ; In 1389 the convent erected a brickworks or tile-making works and acquired the rights, land and wood to build this. In 1428 Archbishop Nikolaus of Bremen renewed the convent's privilege of granting indulgences both for visits made to the church on certain feast days as well as for material aid in building and decoration the church building (Schulze, 432). Again, the nuns were described as poor at this time. The reconstruction of the convent circa 1500 coincided with a reform of the convent according to the guidelines of the Bursfeld Reform. At this time, the prioress was removed and a new prioress installed in the community. The convent's entrance into the Bursfeld Reform was acknowledged in 1514. The convent suffered with the advent of the Lutheran Reformation and lost several of its properties and spiritualities. With the death of Dorothea von Hude and Archbishop Georg of Bremen, who had remained Catholic, the convent became Protestant (Schulze, 434). Nevertheless, all the nuns did not adhere to the Protestant religion until perhaps 1629. On June 6, 1629 the church and cloister were almost totally destroyed by fire. In June of 1630 the convent was restored to the Catholic religion, but the convent and its income was used to help establish Jesuit colleges in the area (Schulze, 436). The nuns received their dowries and were provided with pensions from the church. By 1634, however, the convent had been reestablished under a prioress. In 1683 the convent was converted to an evangelical women's chapter and continues to function as such today. ; The chapels of the Holy Cross and S. Willehad, which were placed under the convent's control, were pilgrimage sites. The chapel of the Holy Cross held a relic of a fragment of the cross (Schulze, 431). (In 1620 the relics of the community were purchased by the archbishop of Bremen). ; Archives for this community are scattered in a variety of repositories. The primary holdings are located in the Archiv der Bremischen Ritterschaft Stade, Stadtmuseum Hildesheim, Dombibliothek Hildesheim (?), Staatsarchiv Stade, and the Staatsarchiv Bremen. ; NeuenwaldeÂ Verzeichnis der Stifter und KlÃ¶ster Niedersachsens vor der Reformation ; Urkundenbuch des Klosters Neuenwalde, ed.

The convent possessed patronage rights over its convent church and the parish church in Midlum. The pilgrimage chapel of Holy Cross and S. Willhad also belonged to the convent (Schulze, 440). The transfer from Altenwalde to Neuenwalde in 1334 was combined with the incorporation of the Holy Cross chapel into the convent. The convent also possessed the right of presentation in the parish church in Wanna prior to 1417 and in the chapel in HolÃŸel prior to 1495. In 1496 the vicary of S. Michael in the parish church of Altenwalde was incorporated into the convent. Since 1445, the vicary of S. Mary had been incorporated into the convent. In the course of the Reformation, the convent lost its presentation rights. ; Benedictine ; The exact social composition of the convent is unknown, although it appears to have drawn its members from the local nobility. With the convent's transfer to Altenwalde, however, women from Bremen and from the upper levels of the peasantry may have been admitted to the convent. ; According to Schulze, the convent probably never held more than 20 nuns (Schulze, 439). ; In the administrative district of Cuxhaven in the diocese of Hildesheim (since 1824); in the area of Lehe ; Midlum (towards the end of the thirteenth century); from 1400 Altenwalde belonged to Hamburg in the archbishopric of Bremen ; Circa 1508 the convent was visited by the archbishop of Bremen in connection with his mission of reforming the convent along the lines of the Bursfeld Reform. The archbishop promoted a stronger adherence to the Benedictine rule and stricter claustration. During his visit, the convent elected a new prioress, who was consecrated by the archbishop (Schulze, 433). In 1509, at the prioress's request, the archbishop issued a document confirming the election of the prioress and confirming her power in all conventual matters. It also confirmed the convent's right to freely elect its prioresses with the approval of the archbishop. The convent also received the right to freely elect its provosts if necessary, and for twenty years afterwards, it appears to have operated without a provost (Schulze, 433). ; The convent and the S. Pankratius chapel were established sometime after 1219. After 1219 the nave of the church was lengthened and a larger choir built. The church was built, according to Schulze, in the Romanesque style (Schulze, 441). Some of the church's rounded windows were later enlarged with pointed arches. The western tower in brick dates from the fourteenth century. With the exception of this tower, the basic form of the present church is the same as the one prior to 1282. A leaden baptismal font may date from the late thirteenth or fourteenth century; this is the only remnant of the internal fixtures or decoration of the medieval church (Schulze, 441). No remains of the cloister or the conventual outbuildings remain, and there are few documentary references to them. A bequest in 1289 for lights in the dormitory is one of the few records of the cloister buildings. The transfer from Altenwalde to Neuenwalde undoubtedly entailed a new building program, but no documentary records reflect this. References to the repair of the roof appear in 1389. On November 30, 1390 the convent also received a papal indulgence, presumably for repairs to the Holy-cross church (Schulze, 441). In 1389 the convent erected a brickworks or tile-making works and acquired the rights, land and wood to build this. In 1444 a new refectory was built. In 1499/1500 all the convent buildings were destroyed and burned. Choirbooks, documents, tapestries, and chalices were lost in the fire (Schulze, 442). In 1503 the convent received an indulgence-privilege allowing for the reconstruction of the cloister, granted by the papal legate, Cardinal Raimund von Gurk. ; One chalice from the convent remains; it is silver traced with gold. The chalice comes from the late fourteenth century. A patene in the same style has also been preserved. The convent had a seal prior to 1282, but it is no longer extant. The earliest conventual seal dates to 1289. Unfortunately, the seal has shattered into several splintered pieces and cannot be reconstructed. It is believed, from documentary references to it, to have depicted Mary next to the cross or that an older seal from Midlum with the Virgin was used (Schulze, 446). A later seal from the fourteenth century depicts the cross with the words, Sigillum Sancte Crucis in Wolde. Another, smaller seal was also used up until 1417. It is round and depicts a sheild with a cross on it with the words, S. des cruce to nienwolde. Both seals appear with the seal of provost Herbord (1360) in the appendix of the Urkundenbuch (Schulze, 446). ; Besides the prioress, the only other positions mentioned are those of custrix and vestiaria (Schulze, 439). (Prioresses from 1508-1654 are not listed). ; References to a monastic library only occur quite late in the historical record. In 1630 reference is made to Catholic books and choir books which were destroyed, but it does not record the age of these books (Schulze, 441). ; The dukes of Sachsen-Lauenburg circa 1307 and the knights of Bederkesa acted as patrons of the community. According to Hoogeweg, Archbishop Giselbert of Bremen provided for the community richly after its transfer to Altenwalde (Hoogeweg, 96). ; Excavations in 1969 revealed the remains of a clay floor for a wooden church dating from the ninth century underneath the present building (Schulze, 441). With the exception of this tower, the basic form of the present church is the same as the one prior to 1282. A leaden baptismal font may date from the late thirteenth or fourteenth century; this is the only remnant of the internal fixtures or decoration of the medieval church (Schulze, 441). No remains of the cloister or the conventual outbuildings remain, and there are few documentary references to them. They were no longer in existance after 1629. ; In 1496 the vicary of S. Michael in the parish church of Altenwalde was incorporated into the convent. Since 1445, the vicary of S. Mary had been incorporated into the convent.";FAUX

The Humiliati were a fascinating and economically significant religious movement that originated in Lombardy (Northern Italy) in the 12th century. Vercelli, being in Piedmont and close to Lombardy, was well within their sphere of influence and activity.

The Humiliati Order:

Origins: Began as a lay penitential movement around the mid-12th century. Members sought a life of simplicity, poverty, prayer, and manual labor, often while remaining with their families initially.
Three Branches: By the early 13th century, with papal approval (notably from Innocent III around 1201), the Humiliati were formally organized into three orders:
First Order: Canons (priests) and lay brothers living a communal life under a rule.
Second Order: Nuns living in enclosed communities.
Third Order (Tertians): Lay men and women living in their own homes, married or single, following a specific rule of life, often congregating for prayer and work. They were particularly crucial to the Humiliati's economic success.
Key Activity: Wool Industry: The Humiliati became famous for their involvement in the wool industry. They were highly skilled in all aspects of wool processing – from sourcing raw wool to producing high-quality finished cloth (often called ""panni umiliati""). This made them economically powerful.
Ethos: Their ethos combined religious piety with industriousness and a commitment to quality work.
S. Agata in Vercelli – A Humiliati House:

""Domus"": A Humiliati establishment was typically called a ""domus"" (house). So, S. Agata in Vercelli would have been a ""Domus degli Umiliati"" associated with or dedicated to St. Agatha.
Likely Composition: The house at S. Agata would most likely have been a community of the First Order (canons and lay brothers) and would have served as a hub for associated Third Order members in Vercelli.
Establishment: Humiliati houses spread rapidly in Northern Italy during the late 12th and 13th centuries. S. Agata in Vercelli would likely have been founded during this period.
Activities of the Humiliati at S. Agata, Vercelli:

Religious Life:
Daily Prayer and Liturgy: The canons would have been responsible for celebrating Mass, the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours), and other religious services in their church (S. Agata).
Communal Living: The First Order members lived a communal life, sharing meals, work, and prayer.
Preaching: Humiliati, especially the canons, were permitted to preach on moral themes (though initially, lay preaching was a point of contention with the Church hierarchy).
Wool Production (Central Activity):
Workshops: The domus at S. Agata would have housed workshops for various stages of wool processing: washing, carding, spinning, weaving, fulling, dyeing, and finishing.
Labor: Lay brothers of the First Order, along with Third Order members and potentially hired lay workers, would have performed the manual labor.
Quality Control: The Humiliati were known for the high quality of their textiles.
Trade and Commerce: They would sell their finished cloth locally and potentially export it, contributing significantly to Vercelli's economy. They were astute business people.
Economic Activities beyond Wool:
They might have engaged in other crafts or agricultural activities on any lands they owned.
They were also involved in financial activities, sometimes acting as lenders or managing funds.
Charitable Work:
Part of their ethos included care for the poor. They might have distributed alms, provided some form of relief, or even run small hospitals or hospices, although wool production was their main distinguishing feature.
Administration and Management:
The head of the house (the ""minister"" or ""praepositus"") would oversee the religious life, economic activities, and administration of the domus and its properties.
Association with Third Order Members:
The domus would have been a spiritual and organizational center for the lay Humiliati (Third Order) in Vercelli. These tertians, living in their own homes, were often deeply involved in the wool trade under the umbrella of the Humiliati organization, benefiting from its network, quality standards, and reputation.
Later History and Suppression:

Over time, many Humiliati houses, including potentially S. Agata, accumulated considerable wealth. This sometimes led to accusations of worldliness and a decline in their original spiritual fervor.
The male branches of the Humiliati Order (First and Third) were suppressed by Pope Pius V in 1571 due to various issues, including alleged corruption and resistance to reform. The Second Order (nuns) continued to exist for longer.
The properties of the suppressed Humiliati houses, like S. Agata in Vercelli, were typically transferred to other religious orders or to diocesan control, or sometimes secularized.";FAUX

Italy was crucial for them as it was on the pilgrimage routes to the Holy Land and a key area for recruitment and fundraising.

Here's what we can infer and what is generally known about Hospitaller houses like a potential ""Domus Dei"" in Asti:

Presence in Asti:

Asti was an important medieval city in Piedmont, a prosperous comune with significant trade and traffic, including pilgrims on routes like the Via Francigena.
It's almost certain the Hospitallers would have had a presence there. They often established themselves in strategically important towns.
The official name might have been something like the Commenda di San Giovanni di Asti (Commandery of St. John of Asti), but ""Domus Dei"" could have been a popular name or a specific part of the complex, especially if it included a notable hospital.
Functions of a ""Domus Dei"" / Hospitaller Commandery in Asti:

Hospitality and Care: True to their name, providing lodging and care for pilgrims, the sick, and the poor would have been a key function. This aligns perfectly with ""Domus Dei.""
Estate Management: Commanderies managed agricultural lands and other properties to generate revenue. This income (""responsions"") was sent to support the Order's headquarters and its military and charitable activities in the East (Holy Land, Rhodes, Malta).
Religious Services: The commandery would have had a church or chapel (often dedicated to St. John the Baptist, their patron) where the brethren (knights, chaplains, sergeants) and the local populace could attend services.
Recruitment: They served as centers for recruiting new members into the Order.
Administration: The Commander would oversee the local estates and represent the Order's interests.
Historical Context:

Foundation: Hospitaller houses in Italy were typically founded from the 12th century onwards.
Relationship with Templars: After the suppression of the Knights Templar in 1312, many of their properties were transferred to the Hospitallers. If there was a Templar house in Asti, the Hospitallers might have acquired it or parts of it. Asti did have a significant Templar presence (e.g., the complex of Santa Maria del Tempio, later San Pietro in Consavia). It's possible the Hospitallers took over or established themselves near former Templar sites.
Later History: Over the centuries, the fortunes of individual commanderies waxed and waned. Wars, political changes, and economic shifts affected them. In Italy, many religious properties were suppressed or reconfigured, particularly during the Napoleonic era (early 19th century) and later with the unification of Italy.
What Might Remain:

It's common for medieval religious buildings in Italian cities to have been repurposed, incorporated into later structures, or for only their church to survive (perhaps as a parish church).
There might be archival records in Asti or in the central archives of the Order of Malta (in Rome) that detail the possessions and activities of the Hospitallers in Asti.
Street names (e.g., ""Via San Giovanni,"" ""Via Ospedale"") can sometimes give clues to former locations.
Archaeological investigations might uncover remains.
Specific to ""Domus Dei (Asti)"":
While ""Domus Dei"" is a generic term, a quick search suggests that the Hospitallers in Asti were indeed associated with a complex that included a hospital, often linked to the Church of San Pietro in Consavia. This church has a long and complex history, with Templar origins before passing to the Hospitallers. The broader complex around San Pietro likely served the functions of a ""Domus Dei."" The Baptistery of San Pietro in Asti is a very famous and ancient structure, and the entire complex has deep historical roots.

The Hospitallers effectively took over the Templar commandery of Asti, which was one of the most important in Northern Italy, centered around the church and hospice complex of San Pietro in Consavia. So, while not perhaps formally named ""Domus Dei"" in all records, the function was certainly there, and the association with the existing significant religious site of San Pietro is key.

Therefore, when looking for the ""Domus Dei Hospitaller"" in Asti, you are essentially looking at the history of the Commenda di San Giovanni/San Pietro in Consavia, which was a major Hospitaller center incorporating hospital functions.";FAUX

Given that the monastery is dedicated to Saint Agatha, a female saint, it was almost certainly a Cistercian nunnery (a convent of Cistercian nuns). Cistercian houses for women were well-established by the 13th century.
Foundation Context (1262 - ""Papal/Ecclesiastic Reform""):

The 13th century was a period of significant religious ferment and reform. While the initial Cistercian boom was in the 12th century (driven by figures like St. Bernard of Clairvaux advocating a return to austerity and the strict Rule of St. Benedict), new foundations continued.
The tag ""Papal/Ecclesiastic Reform"" suggests this foundation was part of a broader effort, perhaps encouraged or sanctioned by the Papacy or local bishops, to strengthen religious life and monastic discipline.
The Cistercians, known for their reformed Benedictine ideals (simplicity, manual labor, austerity, focus on the liturgy), would have been seen as a good model for such reform efforts. Establishing a new Cistercian house, or bringing an existing community under Cistercian rule, would align with these goals.
Medieval Activities of the Cistercian Nuns at S. Agata:

Liturgical Life (Opus Dei - ""Work of God""): This was central. The nuns would have followed a rigorous schedule of communal prayer in the choir, chanting the Divine Office throughout the day and night. This included daily Mass.
Manual Labor (""Ora et Labora"" - Pray and Work):
Textile Work: This was a very common and essential activity for medieval nunneries, including Cistercian ones. They would engage in spinning, weaving (wool, linen), and embroidery. This could be for their own use, for liturgical vestments, or for sale/trade to support the monastery.
Gardening: Cultivating vegetables, fruits, and herbs within the monastery enclosure for food and medicinal purposes.
Scriptorium (Possibly): Some Cistercian nunneries had scriptoria where nuns copied and illuminated manuscripts, though this was perhaps less common or extensive than in male monasteries.
Household Management: All the tasks necessary to run a self-sufficient community: cooking, cleaning, mending, etc.
Spiritual Reading and Contemplation (Lectio Divina): Personal prayer, meditation, and the study of sacred texts were important parts of Cistercian spirituality.
Economic Self-Sufficiency: Cistercian houses aimed for self-sufficiency.
They would have likely owned land (endowed at foundation or acquired later) from which they derived income (e.g., rents from tenant farmers).
Sale of surplus goods (textiles, agricultural produce if they had lay brothers or hired labor for larger-scale farming, though less typical for nunneries to directly manage large estates).
Donations and bequests from patrons.
Enclosure: Cistercian nunneries generally observed strict enclosure, meaning the nuns lived their lives within the monastic walls with limited contact with the outside world. This was for protection, to foster contemplation, and to maintain discipline.
Care for the Sick (Internal): They would have cared for their own sick members within an infirmary.
Limited Hospitality: While Cistercian rules were strict, some limited hospitality would have been offered, perhaps to visiting ecclesiastical figures or female relatives of patrons, within designated areas.
Life within the Monastery:

The community would be led by an Abbess, elected by the nuns.
Life would be structured by the Cistercian interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict, emphasizing obedience, humility, poverty, and silence.
Cistercian architecture was typically austere and functional, avoiding excessive ornamentation, reflecting their reformist ideals. The church and monastic buildings at S. Agata would likely have followed this pattern in their original medieval form.
Location in Biella:

Biella was (and is) a significant town in Piedmont. While early Cistercian male foundations often sought remote ""wilderness"" locations, nunneries were sometimes established closer to or within towns for protection and to facilitate support from the local community and patrons.
Being in Biella, the nunnery would have been part of the religious fabric of the town, interacting with the local church hierarchy and laity, albeit within the bounds of their enclosure.
Later History (up to 1571):

The nunnery existed for over 300 years, through the remainder of the High Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.
Its suppression in 1571 falls within the period of reforms following the Council of Trent (1545-1563). This council led to a widespread reorganization of religious orders, and many smaller or less viable monasteries and convents were suppressed or consolidated, particularly those that didn't fully adhere to new, stricter rules regarding enclosure and discipline for female houses.";FAUX

The foundation stemmed from a vow made by Duke Simon of Tecklenburg when he had an ulcer on his leg. When the ulcer miraculously healed, the convent was founded in return circa 1170 (Schuler, 403). Schuler, however, believes that the convent was more likely founded in 1194 with the settlement of nuns fromÂ Essen. No foundation document exists, but the property of the new convent derived primarily from properties assumed from the foundation ofÂ Essen. The family responsible for the foundation retained the advocacy over it and regarded Malgarten partially as a proprietary convent. It is unclear whether the convent was originally founded as Benedictine. A Benedictine rule is not definite forÂ EssenÂ nor do the convent's first provosts appear to have had close ties to Benedictine observances. The first provost Werner later became the abbot of Liesborn, but was no Benedictine, and the second provost, Friedrich, became abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery of Klarholz (Schuler, 404). The terms used to describe the community (ecclesia and then coenobium and conventus sanctimonialium in 1223) further leave the community's exact status in doubt. The convent did not refer to itself as belonging to the Benedictine order until a document of 1323 (Schuler, 404). ; The existing documents for the community indicate significant changes occurred from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, as indicated by the independence of the provost, the divisions between the prioress and the convent, and the dissolution of the convent's holdings into benefices. The documents further appear to indicate that office-holding nuns (such as the sacristan, cellaress, and verger) were able to generate their own documents independently of the prioress (Schuler, 404). Plundering by Duke Philipp Magnus of Braunschweig-LÃ¼neburg in 1553 resulted in the destruction of the convent's chronicle and many records. During the period of the Lutheran Reformation, Elisabeth von Raden, a nun of the community, disputed with Lutheran preachers (Schuler, 405). ; link to Herzebrock and Gertrudenberg when in-put ; A copy of the prioress's register from the fifteenth century exists.

The only known tithe from Essen comes from the donation of Aldburg and fromÂ Rederlage.InÂ 1223, 1230 and 1250 Malgarten received other rights to tithe. However, tithes never composed a large portion of the convent's income (Schuler, 409). The convent also did not divide many of its lands into fiefs. Only the farm in Markendorf (c. 1240-1269) and the farm in Rederlage (in 1303) were possessed by administrators of the convent. The convent never appears to have divided its property between the prioress and the convent. After the fire of 1490 which destroyed the grain storehouse and resulted in a partial loss of the convent's cattle, the convent received contributions of money, grain and equipment from the surrounding neighborhood and other convents (Schuler, 410). In 1520 Malgarten in turned helped the monastery of Gertrudenberg after a fire there. ; The convent came into conflict with the knights of SÃ¶geln over water rights (although it is unclear whether this occurred during the medieval period) (Schuler, 410). ; Benedictine ; The nuns came from the aristocracy; only daughters of the nobility were admitted as nuns. Entrants brought a dowry with them. Circa 1500 the dowry consisted of 100 Gulden. ; The rule established the number of 10 nuns and additional lay-sisters. By 1596 however the number had shrank to only 5 nuns. The convent's number of inhabitants stayed remarkably stable throughout its history. In 1402 there were 11 nuns including the prioress; 10 in 1440; 10-12 in 1554. The convent's greatest number of inhabitants was recorded in 1759 at 14 nuns and 15 lay-sisters (Schuler, 412). ; OsnabrÃ¼ck ; near the village of Epe; in the principality of Hannover ; The convent church was built in the thirteenth century. It consisted of a two-level ribbed hall with a choir. During the late Gothic period, large windows were inserted into the church. At this time the upper level of the convent's tower was made into a chapter hall. A fire in 1490 destroyed the chapel, dormitory, infirmary, and part of the workroom and required the rebuilding of a portion of the convent's buildings. At this time the church also received murals and an organ. The successor of Prioress Katharina, Alheid von Roden, saw the building of a new mill for the convent (Schuler, 405). After the fire of 1680 the church was redecorated in the Baroque style. ; The church received murals and an organ circa 1490. Only a late gothic chalice from the convent remains. The convent's seal depicts the Madonna enthroned with the Christ child in an oval with the words ""S ce Marie in Malegarde"" around the edge (Schuler, 420). ; Prioresses past the sixteenth century are not listed. The community was secularized in 1803 and the remaining nuns and lay-sisters given pensions. There was little opposition to the secularization. ; A chronicle of the community was written in 1601. There is no mention of a library in the convent's documents nor of the purchase or production of manuscripts. ; Duke Simon of Tecklenburg and his family acted as patrons and advocates for the convent. Simon, his mother Eilika (who foundedÂ Essen), his wife Oda, and three of his children were buried within the convent's church. ; The first members came fromÂ Essen. ; The church and a wing of the cloister still exist. ; The convent's first provost Werner later became the abbot of Liesborn, and the second provost, Friedrich, became abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery of Klarholz (Schuler, 404). Bishop Konrad III from OsnabrÃ¼ck promoted the Bursfeld Reform (a monastic reform) in the convent. In 1472 Mette Budde, a nun from Herzebrock, was established as the new prioress of Malgarten. However, it appears the nuns were not inclined to accept the new reforms (Schuler, 405). After 14 years, she resigned and the convent appointed Katharina from Roden from the convent of Gertrudenberg as the new prioress. The choice of Katharina may indicate an attempt to return to the traditional practices of the convent (Schuler, 405). However, the nuns' attempt failed and the imposition of the Bursfeld Reform in the convent may be definitely dated to the years of Katharina's administration (1486-1518). The Bursfeld Reform resulted in the keeping of more detailed records in the convent, particularly regarding the profession of novices and economic matters. At the time of the convent's foundation, the parish of Essen was incorporated. The convent held no rights in the parish of Malgarten, however. ; The rights of protection were held byÂ EssenÂ as well as by the dukes of Tecklenburg and the bishop of OsnabrÃ¼ck. In 1257 the convent purchased the right to name its own protector for 125 Marks. In 1295 these rights were again sold to the knights of Varendorf for 18 Marks. The convent had a provost over it, who gradually assumed the duties and rights of advocate. ; Few documentary sources for the convent remain. Only a handfull of original documents from the community are extant, including two references to payments of tithes. ; Lay-sisters are only apparent from the eighteenth century. At this time most came from peasant families and were unable to write (Schuler, 413).";FAUX

Maria Delle Grazie). Dominican Arrival and Establishment:

The Dominican Order (Order of Preachers) was founded by St. Dominic in the early 13th century (officially approved 1216). They spread rapidly throughout Europe.
They arrived in Alba in the 13th century, likely around the mid-1200s. The traditional (though perhaps legendary) founding date for the Dominican convent in Alba is often cited as 1260, though some sources suggest a presence even earlier, perhaps by the 1240s.
Like other mendicant orders (e.g., Franciscans), they established themselves within or just outside city walls, aiming to preach to the urban population.
The Church of Santa Maria Maddalena:

The Dominicans in Alba built a church and convent dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene (Santa Maria Maddalena).
The choice of Mary Magdalene was significant. She was a hugely popular saint in the Middle Ages, seen as a model of penitence, conversion, and devoted discipleship. The Dominicans, as an order focused on preaching repentance and conversion, had a particular devotion to her.
The original medieval church would have been built in the prevailing style of the time, likely a form of Gothic architecture, perhaps simpler than grand cathedrals but still substantial. Mendicant churches often featured wide naves to accommodate large congregations for preaching.
Role in Medieval Alba:

Preaching and Religious Life: The primary role of the Dominicans was preaching. Their church would have been a major center for sermons, religious instruction, confession, and other sacraments.
Intellectual Center: Dominicans were renowned for their emphasis on study and theology. While not every convent was a studium generale (a major university-level institution), Dominican houses were centers of learning, with libraries and friars engaged in theological study and preparation for preaching. They played a key role in combating heresies through reasoned argument and education.
Artistic Patronage: Over time, Dominican churches often became repositories of significant artwork, commissioned by the order itself or by wealthy patrons seeking burial and prayers within the church.
Influence on Urban Society: The Dominicans, like the Franciscans, were influential in urban life, guiding civic morality, mediating disputes, and often acting as spiritual advisors to local rulers and prominent families.
Later History (Beyond Medieval):

The Dominican convent and church of S. Maria Maddalena in Alba had a long history, undergoing various transformations, rebuildings, and refurbishments over the centuries.
The most significant changes often came in the Baroque period (17th-18th centuries) when many medieval churches were remodeled.
Like many religious houses, it would have faced suppression during the Napoleonic era (early 19th century).
The current Church of Santa Maria Maddalena in Alba that you see today is largely a Baroque reconstruction (primarily 18th century), though it stands on the site of the medieval Dominican foundation and likely incorporates elements or foundations of the earlier structures. Its facade is particularly notable.
In summary:
In medieval Alba, the Dominican convent and church of S. Maria Maddalena, established in the 13th century, would have been a vital religious, intellectual, and social hub. The friars would have been active preachers and teachers, and their church a focal point for the spiritual life of the city, reflecting the order's commitment to study, orthodoxy, and pastoral care, all under the patronage of the penitent St. Mary Magdalene. While the visible structure today is mostly Baroque, its origins are firmly rooted in the medieval Dominican presence.";FAUX

Mary, the apostles Philip and Jacob, Rupert, and Martin. According to Sigrid KrÃ¤mer, this community began as an Augustinian double house founded at Disibodenberg. It lasted as such until 1165 at which time it became a Benedictine convent of Rupertsberg. It remained a Benedictine convent from 1165-1215. It then switched to a community of Cistercian nuns, which lasted from 1215-1632. The community was transferred in 1632 to Eibingen, where it remained until its final dissolution in 1803. ; Two pictures of the convent of Rupertsberg, one from the time of the Thirty Years War and one from the nineteenth century, as well as additional information about the convent can be found on Dr. Josef Krasenbrink's websiteÂ uni-mainz.de/~horst/hildegard/wirk/erupert.htmlÂ In 1632 the convent was destroyed by Swedish troops, and in 1641 the nuns moved (with their relics) toÂ Eibingen. ; Possible to get picture of Antependium? ; The Landeshauptarchiv in Koblenz preserves manuscripts pertaining to the convent's foundation, #Abt. 701 A VII 3, nr. 5 and 8 Hss., from the 13-18th century, Ausfeld, 119.

Domina Elisa, depicted in the Rupertsberg antependium, served as abbess of the community since 1210. Circa 1233 the names of some of the women in the community are known: Abbess Elisa; her sister, Agnes, who served as prioress; Beatrix, the sexton; Odilia, the cellaress; Sophia, a singer; and Guda, a nun. Thus from the nuns depicted in the antependium, Elisa, Agnes, Sophia, and Guda find documentary mention as late as 1233 (Wilckens, 7). ; Augustinian until 1165; Benedictine since 1165 ; Circa 1210-1230 there were fifteen nuns, ten of whom are named. (See Art/Artifacts field) All the nuns named on the Rupertsberg antependium (except for the two Idas) appear in the Rupertsberg documents, the oldest necrology, or the Protocollum canonisationis B. Hildegardis (Wienand, 162). ; Bingen ; Bingen ; The convent was built in the Ottonian style (see present state of medieval structures). ; The convent is famous for its antependium, made between 1210 and 1230 by the nuns of the convent from costly purple silk with gold, silver and silk embroidery. In fact, Leonie von Wilckens suggests that the purple silk may have come to the convent via plundering in Constantinople during the fourth Crusade (circa 1204) and been given to the community as a gift. Originally, all the halos and the cross of the church held by S. Hildegard were decorated with pearls (Wilckens, 3). The antependium depicts Christ on his heavenly throne in the midst of an oval wound; he raises three fingers of his right hand in blessing and holds a book in the left. The sun and the moon, depicted as heads, and the alpha and omega, as well as eleven stars of various size surround him. From the four sides of the surrounding oval peer the symbols of the evangelists. He is also surrounded on the right-hand side by S. Mary and S. Peter, S. John the Baptist, and Mary Magdalene (depicted below) and on the left-hand side by S. Rupertus and S. Hildegard, S. Martin, and the abbess Adelheid (depicted below). Hildegard is dressed in her habit; she holds a model of the church in her right hand and a book in her left (Wilckens, 6-7). Below Christ's feet are the figures of Siegfried II von Eppstein, archbishop of Mainz and protector of the cloister, and Agnes, Duchess of Nancy and Lothringia, a patron of the convent (Wienand, 161-2). Three other secular donors(?) are depicted and named as Godefridus, Conradus, and (an unnamed) youth. The bottom portion of the antependium is unique in that it depicts ten nuns with their hands raised in prayer to Christ, accompanied by their names. The names read from left to right: Guda, Sophia, Ida, Agnes, D(om)ina Elisa(b), Ida, Sophia, Mechtild, Adelheidis, and Gertrudis. Domina Elisa served as abbess of the community since 1210. It is assumed that they produced the textile. All the nuns named on the Rupertsberg antependium (except for the two Idas) appear in the Rupertsberg documents, the oldest necrology, or the Protocollum canonisationis B. Hildegardis (Wienand, 162). This piece is one of the few surviving examples of textile art from the medieval Rhineland area. The work is housed in the MusÃ©es Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels and measures approximately 96.5 centimeters high and 230 centimeters in width. Originally the tapestry may have been slightly larger; it appears that a few centimeters have been lost due to the effects of time (Wilckens, 3). On the basis of its size and the saints depicted, it is assumed that the antependium was intended for the high altar of the convent church at Rupertsberg (Wilckens, 7). ; While the monastery that S. Hildegard founded in Eibingen no longer survives, there is a small parish church of Eibingen which has a richly decorated shrine with her remains.

According to the customs of the time, a nun's cell was adjoined to the monks' monastery, although the exact location of the cell is uncertain. Jutta of Sponheim was the first to live as a recluse in this cell. A young Hildegard of Bingen and two companions were entrusted to her for an education. It is likely that the monks of the Disibodenberg introduced Hildegard to the complex Benedictine traditions and provided her with a broad intellectual education. In 1136 Jutta, the ""mistress"" of the female hermitage on the Disibodenberg, died and Hildegard was unanimously elected as her successor.

Kloster St. Katharinental;Dominican;;Saint Catherine;1245;1869;624;Secularization;Switzerland;CHE;Wiler;46,4074;7,7870;female;;;;personal research NY;;"This was a very important Dominican nunnery (Dominikanerinnenkloster).

Here's what life and activities would have been like at Kloster St. Katharinental in medieval times:

Foundation and Context:

Founded: Around 1245. This places its establishment during the flourishing period of the Dominican Order and the growth of female monasticism.
Location: Wiler bei Diessenhofen, Canton Thurgau, Switzerland. A relatively rural setting but strategically near the Rhine.
Dominican Second Order: The nuns belonged to the Second Order of Preachers, supporting the Dominican friars' mission through prayer, contemplation, and penance.
Patronage: Likely founded and supported by local noble families and perhaps the Bishop of Constance (as Thurgau was within that diocese).
Life of the Dominican Nuns:

Rule of St. Augustine and Dominican Constitutions: Their life was governed by these, emphasizing contemplative prayer, community, study, and regular observance.
Contemplative Prayer (Core Purpose):
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanted in choir at set times, following the Dominican Rite.
Daily Mass: Celebrated by Dominican friars or other appointed priests.
Mental Prayer and Meditation: Significant time dedicated to personal prayer.
Study and Intellectual Life (Veritas):
A key Dominican characteristic. Nuns engaged in reading Scripture, Church Fathers, lives of saints, and Dominican spiritual writers.
St. Katharinental became a major center for German female mysticism (Frauenmystik) in the 14th century. The nuns were deeply influenced by figures like Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, and Henry Suso. They produced and read mystical texts in the vernacular (Middle High German).
Strict Enclosure (Cloister): The nuns lived a strictly enclosed life.
Community Life: Governed by a Prioress, living in common.
Manual Labor:
Exquisite Textile Work: St. Katharinental was particularly famous for its liturgical embroidery (Paramentenstickerei) and tapestries of exceptionally high artistic quality. Many surviving examples are now in museums.
Manuscript Production: Copying and illuminating manuscripts was a vital activity. They produced beautiful choir books, devotional texts, and spiritual treatises.
Spinning and Weaving.
Gardening within the cloister.
Baking and other domestic tasks.
Significance and Artistic Legacy:

Center of Mysticism: As mentioned, it was one of the most important centers of female mysticism in the German-speaking world. The spiritual writings and experiences of its nuns were significant.
Artistic Powerhouse: Beyond mystical texts, St. Katharinental is renowned for:
Embroideries and Tapestries: Some of the finest surviving examples of medieval textile art.
Manuscript Illumination.
Devotional Sculptures: It was known for producing or housing important devotional sculptures, including ""Christus-Johannes-Gruppen"" (Christ and St. John groups) and other devotional images that fostered mystical piety.
Influence: The spiritual and artistic output of St. Katharinental influenced other convents in the region.
Challenges and Endurance:

The Reformation: Thurgau was a contested area during the Reformation. While many monasteries in Switzerland were dissolved, St. Katharinental managed to survive, though it faced significant challenges and periods of hardship. It remained a Catholic enclave.
Later History: The monastery continued to exist for centuries.
Dissolution:

Kloster St. Katharinental was eventually dissolved in 1869 by the government of the Canton of Thurgau during the period of the Kulturkampf (a conflict between secular state and Catholic Church).
The buildings were subsequently used for various purposes, including as a hospital or care facility. Parts of the complex are preserved and recognized for their historical and artistic importance.
In summary, the Dominican nunnery of St. Katharinental in Wiler bei Diessenhofen was a highly significant medieval institution in Switzerland. It was renowned not only for its dedicated contemplative life but also as a major center of German female mysticism and for the outstanding artistic quality of its manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and tapestries.";

History
During the 12th century, the area around Münchenbuchsee was part of the lands of the Baron of Buhse. In 1180, Cuno of Buhse or Buchsee granted all of his lands to the Order of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller. This land grant included the villages of Münchenbuchsee, Wankdorf and Worblaufen as well as vineyards on Lake Biel. In 1192, the Pope confirmed this gift on the knights. Shortly thereafter it was converted into a commandery under the Order. The neighboring nobility and the citizens of Bern granted the commandery additional lands. This included the church at Twann (1252), Moosseedorf (1256), Krauchthal (1273), Bremgarten (1306), Wohlen (1320), the castle, court and village of Moosseedorf (1256–57) and the district of Bremgarten (1306). The commandery had its own seal by 1264. Bern granted the commandery limited rights of citizenship in 1329.[1]

Originally the commandery was surrounded by a wall, though this was eventually demolished. The south side of the complex contained the courtyard of the oldest part of Cuno's castle, the monastery (housing for the knights), the commander's house and a church. The church's choir was built in 1260-80 and the stained glass is from the 13th century. The current church tower was built in 1891. On the north side of the complex there was a summer house, a guesthouse and workshops.[1]

The monastic community was always quite small. In 1480, only the commander, the prior and six knights lived there. In keeping with the Rule of Life of the Order, the knights at the commandery were responsible for providing pastoral care to the people of the area, operating a pilgrims' hospital and caring for the poor. The commander of Münchenbuchsee often was also appointed the head of the Thunstetten Commandery.

At the start of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland in 1528, Commander Peter Englisberg, who headed both houses, supported the secularization of the two commanderies, for which he received Bremgarten Castle as a reward. The commander's house became a rectory, the monastery and outbuildings became a granary and the remaining buildings were used to administer the bailiwick of Münchenbuchsee. On the north side a bailiff's castle and tithe barn were built in 1600-20, on the site of a medieval building";

References in the vita indicate that the remaining wealth of her parents also came to Adelheid after their deaths. Adelheid used some of the lands for the convent, but she also used others to make charitable donations to the poor (see charitable work). Some of the property of the sisters who entered the community went to the abey, although as canonesses they could also retain this wealth and use lay personnel to administer it for them. ; Vilich's lands and the appeal of the cult of Adelheid brought in enough wealth for the small community to carry out the wishes of the founders throughout several centuries of the convent's existence. The rebuilding of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (Vilich IV) put the convent's finances in a precarious state. The convent was 'rescued' by the Archbishop of Cologne in return for his control of its affairs henceforth. ; The abbey ran a school for girls. Bertha records that Abbess Adelheid was much concerned with education and visisted the convent school frequently to teach and examine the young scholars. She was also interested in the liturgical life of the convent. ; Canons were initially attached to the abbey and officiated at Mass.";"10337 ; The abbey of Vilich was founded circa 980 by Megengoz and his wife Gerberga. They used their manor as the basis for the new foundation. Their youngest daughter, Adelheid, became the community's first abbess. Gerberga ""redeemed"" Adelheid from the convent of S. Ursula in Cologne where she had been educated and was dwelling with a gift of land. Gerberga wished initially to found a community of Benedictine nuns, but Adelheid desired the less strict life of a canoness. The initial community was thus created as a community of canonesses, a rather late foundation for such a community, and did not initially adhere to the Benedictine rule. With the death of Gerberga (sometime around 996) Adelheid and the canonesses of Vilich decided to adopt the stricter Benedictine rule, perhaps in memory of Gerberga's initial wish. Abbess Adelheid was not completely successful in this change and her chapter refused to agree. She even lost some of her canonesses. Supported by her sister, Abbess Bertrada of Santa Maria in Cologne, Adelheid eventually turned Vilich into a Benedictine nunnery. The founders built the original church and convent as well as procured a charter of immunities modeled on those of the imperial abbeys ofÂ Quedlinburg,Â Gandersheim, andÂ EssenÂ from Emperor Otto III and his mother Theophanu. The immunities gave the community of Vilich the right to freely elect their abbess, and no judges or advocate could intrude on the convent without the permission of the abbess and the congregation. One charter mentions that the abbess ought to be a member of the founder's family, but this ceased to be the case after the second abbess. The abbey ceased to exist as a community on September 4, 1802 and its lands and possessions went ot the princely house of Nassau-Usingen. ; Adelheid of Vilich (c.970-1015) was the youngest daughter of Megengoz and Gerberga. She was made abbess of Vilich at a young age, perhaps seventeen or a bit older. She was evidently much younger than her brother and sisters and her parents were middle aged at the time of her birth. Adelheid entered the convent of S. Ursula in Cologne and was educated there as a child. She was probably there in 977 when her brother was killed and her parents began the foundation of Vilich. Bertha records that Abbess Adelheid was much concerned with education and visisted the convent school frequently to teach and examine the young scholars. She was also interested in the liturgical life of the convent. She worked with the sisters to perfect the proper methods of singing the offices. Bertha records an incident when one sister could not carry a tune. The abbess eventually lost her patience with the singer and boxed her ears; henceforth the sister was endowed with true pitch! (Mater Spiritualis: The Life of Adelheid of Vilich) Saint Adelheid was known for her miracles of healing, curing of demonic possession, and one instance of releasing the chains from a prisoner. Her well supposedly cures eye diseases. The cult of Adelheid of Vilich was formally approved in 1966. ; The abbey contained the tomb and remains of Saint Adelheid and became a cult center almost as soon as the abbess had died. The cult of Adelheid brought so many pilgrims that the abbey's church was expanded and rebuilt (Vilich III). Berta/Bertha describes the transfer of Adelheid's remains to a tomb within the church from its original site in the cloister. The sandstone sarcophagus, still present today, is the original, although Adelheid's remains are no longer extant. In the thirteenth century, Adelheid's tomb was moved into the Adelheid-chapel. Evidence indicates that the relics still existed in the church in the sixteenth century; a violent local war in the 1580s severley damaged the church and probably destroyed any relics or burial remains. Adelheid's body may have been taken from the sarcophagus at this time as well. ; Link to communities of S. Maria im Kapitol & S. Ursula when entered w/more information. ; Manuscript sources for this community are located in the Staatsarchiv of the Province of Nordrhein-Westfalen in DÃ¼sseldorf. The Vita of S. Adelheid of Vilich by Berta/Bertha (Vita Adelheidis) survives in two medieval manuscripts located in the Royal Library in Brussels and in the British Museum in London, Harley 2800, fol. 207v. ; Mater Spiritualis: The Life of Adelheid of Vilich ; Vita Adelheidis Abbatissae VilicensisÂ and in Achter's Die Stiftskirche St. Peter in Vilich. Translated in English inÂ Mater Spiritualis: The Life of Adelheid of Vilich. ; The family of Adelheid of Vilich had ties to the Ottonian ruling house. Members of the Vilich founding family were close relatives to Otto III and Empress Theophanu. One of the Empress's granddaughters became abbess of Vilich. Adelheid's sister, Imiza, a friend of the empress may have spent her widowhood at Vilich and died there circa 995. The convent also had ties to the Empress Kunigunde. In a charter of 1003 reaffirming Vilich's immunities, Henry II declared that she was the intercessor and that it was at her request that he had ordered the charter. It is possible that Adelheid and Kunigunde knew each other. Irmingard, of the famous Hammersteiner divorce, may have spent some time at Vilich and may have met Otto of Hammerstein there. ; The first abbess, Saint Adelheid of Vilich, made the community a popular pilgrimage site. Her well is supposed to cure eye diseases. She was succeeded by her niece, then Mathilda, daughter of Ezzo of Aachen. ; Adelheid contributed some of her familial property to charitable works. Fifteen beggars were to be fed and clothed from the profits of one manor in perpetuity; fifteen solidi of money were to be given to them at Christmas. Another fifteen beggars were to be looked after by the convent and these were to receive a sum of money at Lent, as well as payments on the feastdays of the Apostles and at three of the quarter-days. These charitable bequests were still in force in 1804 when the sisters were expelled from the abbey by Duke Fredrick Augustus of Nassau-Usingen. ; The charters from Vilich refer to several problems with their lay advocates. ; Benedictine ; The vita of Adelheid provides a detailed record of her family. Megengoz and Gerberga had several children: a son, Godfrey, who died on the Slavic frontier in 977; two daughters who became nuns (one was Adelheid); and two daughters who married and had children. Entrants to the community were chosen by either the abbess or the sisters themselves. In the vita, Bertha addresses one of her prologues to the resident canonesses and hopes that her efforts will result in her full admittance to their circle. Bertha was the sister of Abbot Wolfhelm of Brauweiler, who died in 1091. Their parents were Frumold, a noble, and his wife, Eveza, called a duaghter of Count Sicco. Bertha was likely Wolfhelm's youngest sister, born circa 1020. It is known that she dwelled at Vilich from 1050-1060. The family of Adelheid had ties to the Ottonian ruling family. A granddaughter of Empress Theophanu became an abbess of Vilich. Abbess Mathilda (mid-eleventh century), who built the third revision of the abbey church, came from the Ezzonen family, which existed on the fringes of the royal house. ; The Vilich community was not very large; there were about fifteen to twenty sisters in the beginning and no more than thirty-five at its height. In addition, there was a school for girls and a number of servants, as well as canons, priests, and visiting laity and pilgrims, who dwelled outside the abbey walls. ; The community lay on the eastern side of the Rhine River, directly across the river from the modern city of Bonn. ; Vilich is located at the confluence of the Rhine and the Sieg and the convent lay on the eastern side of the Rhine. ; The church was rebuilt at least three times in the Middle Ages and twice in the seventeenth century. The community was never a very large complex. The buildings were probably surrounded by a wall. The cloister was likely situated on the south side of the complex. Archaeological work was undertaken by the University of Bonn and the Rheinisches Landesmuseum under the directorship of Irmingard Achter from 1949-1955. The archaeological survey recovered the remains of a Frankish cemetery (5-8th c.) on the site and the earliest Vilich church was placed in the midst of this cemetery. Remains of this small church were found within the fabric of the present church and all later rebuildings followed the original placement of nave and altar. The early church was erected in the eighth or ninth century (known as Vilich I). The founders used this early church when they began their construction circa 980. The original building was a rectangle measuring 6 meters long and 5.30 meters wide. In the tenth century, another room was added, circa 3.8 meters wide and 4.7 meters long, which was used as a chancel. This church probably existed as a proprietary church of the estate belonging to Megengoz and Gerberga in 980 and formed a part of the original property from which the abbey acquired its wealth. Vilich II, the first abbey church, was finished by 987. The church had a single nave, 9 meters wide and 25.10 meters long, with a rectangular choir. The main entrance was on the western side in the form of a ""Westwerk."" The choir was at the eastern end and contained the chancel of the original church (Vilich I). A cloister was located at the south side of the church. Evidence exists for a small annex to the choir which eventually became part of the crypt. This is probably the site of the burials of Gerberga (d. c. 996) and Megengoz (d.c. 999). The 1955 excavation found the tomb of Gerberga and Megengoz. The second abbey church (Vilich III) was constructed between 1020-1040 on the site of the first and the old wall foundations were used for the pillars of the central nave. The principal 'builder' was the abbess Mathilda. The Westwerk remained, but the entrance may have been moved to the north side. The central nave remained 9 meters wide, each of the side naves were 3.65 meters wide and remain so today with the addition of two side chapels. The church had a flat ceiling about 10.80 meters in height. The rectangular transcepts and the semi-circular sanctuary/chancel were added at this point. Below the sanctuary was a Ringkrypta so that the altar rose above the floor approximately 1.8 meters. In the twelfth and thirteenth century other alterations were made, such as the vaulted ceiling and the addition of a Gothic choir that destroyed the old Ringkrypta at the eastern end. A special chapel was built for the cult of Adelheid, the Adelheid-chapel. These finally changes are referred to as Vilich IV. The sisters at Vilich initially stood at the western end of the nave. In the early thirteenth century, a Gothic choir was built surrounding the older one, but the canonesses probably used a side altar, such as the chapel of Adelheid, for their private services. The main choir was used by the canons attached to the abbey who officiated at the Mass (Mater Spiritualis: The Life of Adelheid of Vilich).Â VilichVilich ; A seal for the community of Vilich exists from 1242 onwards. The oval seal depicts Saint Peter holding a cross and key atop a crescent moon. At the bottom of the seal stands Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and a book in his left hand. Above Christ stand two figures, a man on the left and a woman on the right, identified as Megengoz and Gebirgus, who present a replica of the church of Vilich. The inscription reads: ""Sigilium Ecclesie Sancti Petri in Viliche."" ; The Vita Adelheidis by Berta/Bertha ; Menengoz and Gerberga, founders; the counts of JÃ¼lich served as the lay advocates of Vilich in the twelfth century; Otto III and Empress Theophanu. Vilich had relatively close ties to the Ottonian ruling house. ; The first abbess was the youngest daughter of the founders, Adelheid (c.970-1015). Adelheid was at the convent of Saint Ursula in Cologne when Vilich was founded, and it may be likely that Gerberga drew the first members of the community of Vilich from this convent. Adelheid converted the community of canonesses circa 1000 to the Benedictine rule. When her sister died in 1002, Adelheid also assumed leadership of the convent ofÂ S. Maria im KapitolÂ in Cologne. Adelheid was famed for her care of the poor and was held in high regard by both the people and rulers of the region. Adelheid later became a saint, and her vita was written by a young nun of the convent, Berta/Bertha. ; The church still stands and was restored to its thirteenth-century interior by renovation work done between 1955 and 1965. The transcepts and the choir are mediaeval. Alterations to the church made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries altared the basic plan of the medieval church, shortening the nave and adding a tower to the west entrance, which remain today. The exterior of the church was always plastered. The medieval part is painted a reddish tint, which was the surviving colour; the nave and steeple are painted white in the style of the seventeenth century. ; The community of Vilich was much influenced by the archbishop of Cologne. Archbishop Heribert (d. 1021) held Adelheid in high esteem and appointed her as abbess of Santa Maria (S. Maria-im-Kapitol) in Cologne after the death of her sister, Bertrada, circa 1000. She succeeded her sister Bertrada in this office. She thus functioned as abbess both of Vilich and Santa Maria simultaneously. According to Bertha, Heribert also put Adelheid in charge of poor relief in times of famine. ; Having been granted imperial immunities, the community existed as a free institution. This was the case through the eleventh century, but the abbey lay too close to Cologne not to be influenced by its archbishop, under whose influence it eventually fell. Vilich had relatively close ties to the Ottonian ruling house. ; The charter of 944 by Otto I pardoning Adelheid's father Megeengoz for his rebellion and returning his lands; the Otto III foundation charter of 987; the eleventh-century copy of the 996 charter of Pope Gregory V (which was issued on May 24, 996); the thirteenth-century copy of Henry II's 1003 reaffirmation of Vilich's immunities.

In 839 the relics of S. Felicitas, Felicissimus and Agapitus were conveyed to this house. The word monasterium is not used; it is thus not clear whether the convent already existed or whether these relics were transferred to a church in this location (Lobbedey, 326). According to excavations, until the eleventh century only a church existed in Vreden, which functioned simultaneously as a chapter and parish church. The founder is also controversial. The tradition of Vreden recognizes Count Walbert as the founder. The first mention of this count, however, appears in a memorial book dating to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (Lobbedey, 326). A stone memorial dating circa 1100 also mentions the Count Walbert, with the words ""sacred through your bones"" (sacra per ossa tui). This may indicate that the count was indeed the founder of the convent. This Walbert has also been identified as the founder of the community of Wildeshausen, and as the son of Wigbert and a grandson of Widukind (Lobbedey, 326). Whether or not Walbert was the original founder, the community's establishment was associated with the noble family of Billung. This convent was an imperial abbey until 1085. ; Monasticon Westfaliae. ; From 994 until her death, Abbess Hathui from the community ofÂ GernrodeÂ served as the head of this house. From 1014-1044 the daughter of King Otto II, Adelheid, was abbess of the community. In the eleventh century, the convent was therefore an imperial chapter (Lobbedey, 327). ; The chapter church of S. Felicitas is a Romanesque building, dating from the twelfth century with a vestibule crypt from the eleventh century. The church was rebuilt and explaned three times, and a completely new construction was erected in the Ottonian period (Lobbedey, 328). The earliest period of construction for the church dates to the eighth century. The church of S. Felicitas is considered a new construction of the eleventh century. The crypt, however, stems from an eirlier construction (Lobbedey, 329). In the tenth and eleventh century the churches of S. Felicitas and S. George, the parish church, stood next to each other (Lobbedey, 330). It is likely that under the foundations of the church of S. Felicitas lies an earlier church, which preceeded the cloister and later incorporated it, and which may have served as a lay parish church (Lobbedey, 330). ; The abbesses were confirmed by the archbishop of Cologne. ; The convent is later associated with the Billung family. In 1016 Count Wichman was buried in the convent after his murder (Lobbedey, 327).";FAUX

At this time the community was a noble female foundation. The community was founded at the wish of Count Hermann; he is perhaps the founder or a member of the founder's family (Heineken, 33). According to Lobbedey a certain Emhildis is named as the community's foundress (Lobbedey, 330). According to Hoemberg, Emhildis was a member of the family of the previous Counts of Werl (Hoemberg, 110). In the tenth century Meschede is considered a familial foundation of these Counts (Lobbedey, 332). Since 1310 male canons inhabited the convent. ; A market, mint, and tolls are attested to Meschede for the year 958. As a settled community, Meschede may be older than the convent, just as wereÂ FreckenhorstÂ andÂ VredenÂ (Lobbedey, 334). ; The convent had relics of S. Walburga. In 958 Walburga became the patron saint of Meschede, and the convent received relics of the saint. ; Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands ; Boehmer Regesta imperii I.

The church had a basilica with three naves and a tower in the west as well as a crypt. In the west wall of the middle crypt there is a place for reliquaries. The crypt may have been erected at the time of the translation of the relics of S. Walburga. In 958 Walburga became the patron saint of Meschede, and the translation of her bones is not possible prior to 893. On the basis of this, the period of construction for the church is between 897 and 912 (Lobbedey, 332). Because the date of the church is much later than the foundation of the convent, it is possible that an earlier church was located at Meschede. The cloister joined the church on its south side. The west portion of the cloister with medieval components existed until its destruction in 1945. The convent also had a chapel dedicated to Mary Magdalene (Lobbedey, 334). On the north side the church was surrounded by graves. ; Very little is known about the early history of this convent. ; Among the possessions of the convent are gifts from Louis the Pious and the Count Ricdag, granted in 833.";FAUX

In 1229 various unidentified citizens of Cologne constructed a house for this order on property belonging to S. Pantaleon without having obtained proper permission from the abbot. The abbot and monks were unsympathetic to this order for reformed prostitutes. They lodged a protest with Archbishop Henry I of Molenark; Henry responded in September of 1229 by ceding a different property to the convent , to which it was moved.

Of the nine nuns identified, only three were patrician and six were middle-class. By the mid-thirteenth century the convent was primarily for middle-class women. In this respect it was unique. ; The Ordo sororum poenitentium Mariae Magdalenae, also known as the Reuerinnen in Germany, received papal recognition by 1227. The order included primarily, if not exclusively, prostitutes who had converted to a life of poverty and chastity. Houses of the order of S.

Altfrid used his own property. He retained a voice in the administration of the convent property; the convent's use of this property was confirmed by the bishops and archbishops assembled in Cologne (Heineken, 36-37). Altfrid had been a monk, so it is possible that the convent was founded as a Benedictine community (Heineken, 37). Although the authenticity of the foundation document is disputed, the following facts can be ascertained: Bishop Altfrid founded a church within his own property dedicated to the saints Cosmas, Damian, and Mary. He gathered together a congregation of religious women, for whom he provided sustenance and provided a ""mother."" The convent appears to have followed regulations for a common life (Heineken, 43). The synod of Cologne may have been called upon to confirm the foundation, but the community had no tie to the church in Cologne. According to Kramer, the community operated as a noble women's chapter from circa 845/852 until 947. In 947 it became a free imperial foundation and existed until 1803. ; A tenth century letter from a female student in Essen reveals that she was instructed in grammar, reading and singing by two canonesses. The letter reads: ""Domina magistra felhin date mihi licenciam in hac nocte vigilare cum magistra adalu et ego vobis ambabus manibus confirmo atque iuro ut per totam noctem declinare volo aut legere aut pro seniore nostro cantare Valete et ut peto facite"" The manuscript is held in the university and regional library in DÃ¼sseldorf, Ms. B 3, fol. 305v. ; Obtain image of lectionary page with abbess Svenhild. ; Numerous manuscripts survive from the community's library. ; Die AnfÃ¤nge der sÃ¤chsischen FrauenklÃ¶ster ; [Letter to Matilda, abbess of Essen, 973-1011]; ; 1.

A commentary on the Psalms, created in the tenth century at the community of Essen, later came into the possession of the canonesses atÂ Gernrode. The manuscript indicates that the canonesses were active in teaching and manuscript production. ; This community evidently had an extensive library and the extant works from the house date back to the ninth century. The existing manuscripts include several Missals and sacraments, two memorial books, the statutes and constitutions of the community, as well as works by Augustine, Alcuin, Hrabanus Maurus, Bernard of Clairveaux, Gregory M., Hugo de S. Victore, Jacques de Voragine, Dionysius Exiguus, Prudentius, and Goffr. de Trano. (see manuscript sources) ; The authenticity and date of the document recording Altfrid's foundation is disputed by scholars. The existing document was likely not written prior to the eleventh century. It is not a uniform work; the document records the foundation of the community and the grant of privileges to the community, but these two items have no internal connection. The existing document may be based on an earlier document (Heineken, 37-41). See alsoÂ Die GrÃ¼ndungsurkunde der FrauenkommunitÃ¤t Essen - eine FÃ¤lschung aus der Zeit um 1090";FAUX

Since the community's foundation, it appears to have held possessions near the city of Bonn. Other possessions of the chapter lay around the areas of Godesberg, Kirspenich, Hangelar near Kalkar, Winterswick near Rheinberg, and Sotzheim. The chapter had the right to obtain wood in the location of Kottenforst, in return for which it was obliged to give each of the two foresters a candle of a pound of wax at Candlemas. The chapter's possession were not small, yet its financial situation seems to have never been terribly good (see above). ; According to a reference from Archbishop Friedrich II from 1158, the community ""flowered abundantly in possessions"" (amplissimis quondam floreret possessionibus), but suffered from the unfavorable situation of his day. According to the archbishop, the community's farms in Effern and Fischenich were fallen into ruin and the workers there were no longer able to pay the small fee of 10 denarii. Abbess Adelheid therefore reduced the payment to 2 denarii. The abbess also provided 1 mark from her own income for the establishment of their buildings. Likewise, a reference from 1360 indicated that the community's financial condition was still not very favorable. In this year the nuns from Stoppenberg complained that income owed to them by the chapter of S. Maria im Kapitol had not been paid for 3 years. ; In the thirteenth century, the community was active in leasing out houses within the city of Cologne. A document from 1227 arranged the lease of a house near the dormitory for 3 shillings and 6 denarii; another from 1233 leased a house for 2 shillings; and a third documented the lease of a house near the fishmarket for 3 marks yearly in 1248.";"Marienstift auf dem Kapitol; sancta Maria in Capitolio; monasterio sanctae Mariae; ecclesia sanctae Mariae; monasterium novum; NeumÃ¼nster; Maria alta; Maria MalzbÃ¼chel; sent Mergen ; This chapter of canons and canonesses is first mentioned in the testament of Archbishop Bruno I of 965. The chapter had already been founded at this date, and the archbishop conveyed 100 pounds of silver and other donations to the community in his testament. According to the legend of the community's foundation, it was founded by Plectrudis, the wife of Pipin of Heristal, on the foundations of an earlier Roman fort (capitolium) and royal palace.Â S. Maria im Kapitol, Romanesque plaque of S. PlectrudisS. Maria im Kapitol, Gothic plaque of S. PlectrudisS. Maria im Kapitol, Gothic plaque of S. Plectrudis (detail)Â Reputedly, Plectrudis founded the community when she retired to Cologne while Pipin was involved with Alpais. Accordingly, the community would have first been established around the year 689. The Chronica regia also recorded that Plectrudis retired to Cologne in this year and built a church with nuns near her residence. Although the necrology listed Plectrudis as the chapter's foundress, her involvement in the foundation still remains disputed. In order to differentiate the community from the community ofÂ S. Caecilia, which was also dedicated to Mary originally, it was referred to as the new monastery (monasterium novum or NeumÃ¼nster). Alternately, the community was described as Maria alta, on account of its elevated location, or Maria MalzbÃ¼chel, after a street of this name located nearby. In the local dialect, the community was often referred to as ""sent Mergen."" The church was consecrated in 1049 by Pope Leo IX. ; The chapter shared its church with the local parish. In 1270 a dispute arose between the parish and Abbess Hadewig over the appointment of the parish priest. The appointee of the abbess was later confirmed in the position. In 1299 Abbess Hadewig faced a second dispute with the parish, whose resolution she did not live to see. In 1275 Pope Gregory X confirmed the ability of the chapter to freely elect its abbesses. The canonesses originally wore no specific habit, but by 1482 the pope prescribed a white cloak for them. The abbess was permitted to wear ermine on her cloak. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, one of the canonesses, Swenholdis von Harff, left the community to marry Gumprecht von Alpen. The community was dissolved in 1803 under the direction of Napoleon. ; Die wichtigeren Stifte, Abteien und KlÃ¶ster in der alten ErzdiÃ¶zese KÃ¶ln ; A sister of Pope Leo IX was a nun of this community. In 1330 Petrarch visited the chapter while in Cologne. ; An abbess by the name of Wolfereda from Saint Maria im Kapitol was mentioned in 966 by the discovery of relics of Saint Maurinus in the community of Saint Pantaleon. Wolfereda was followed as abbess by Bertrada, the third daughter of the count Megingoz, whose youngest sister Adelheid was the abbess ofÂ Vilich. After the death of Bertrada, Adelheid was the leader of both communities. In 1270 a dispute arose between the parish and Abbess Hadewig over the appointment of the parish priest. The appointee of the abbess was later confirmed in the position. In 1299 Abbess Hadewig faced a second dispute with the parish, whose resolution she did not live to see. Abbess Hadewig was followed in office by Abbesses Kunigunde and Imagina. In 1357 Abbess Elisabeth from Katzenelnbogen became involved in a dispute with the knight, Simon of Kempenich, who demanded entrance for his daughter into the community. Reputedly, his son abused the canonesses during this time. The abbess finally turned the matter over to the archbishop. ; The community appears to have run a type of home for elderly women, over which the abbess had oversight and was responsible for appointing priests. ; The canons appear to have been drawn from a lower social status than the canonesses. A reference from 1216 by Abbess Gerbirgis noted the debts of the deceased canons. ; The number of canonesses hovered around 24, while only 12 canons were attached to the community. By the eighteenth century, these numbers were reduced to 18 canonesses, 11 canons, and 22 vicars. ; Cologne ; Cologne ; The romanesque church was consecrated in 1049 by Pope Leo IX.Â S. Maria im Kapitol, architectural planÂ In 1434 the church suffered damage during a storm, in which reportedly the lead tiles of the tower were carried across the Rhine river towards the town of Deutz. The tower fell down from age in 1637. The chapter church, and particularly its bells, was frequently used by the city council of Cologne for disseminating information. For example, after the election of a new mayor, a mass was held in the chapter church. ; Hermann Joseph, a monk in Steinfeld (d. 1236), mentioned an image of the Virgin handing an apple to the Christ child, which belonged to the community. On December 3, 1304 Bishop Heinrich Jonghen consecrated a crucifix with the figure of Christ in the church. A heavily damaged Romanesque statue of the Virgin with the Christ child is preserved within the church.Â S. Maria im Kapitol, Virgin Mary with Christ childÂ Likewise, two plaques for the burial of S.

By 1300 they were also being referred to as sisters (sorores). They were required to bring a dowry. ; The Romanesque structure of the medieval church and a portion of the cloister are still extant, although the structure experienced significant damage during the bombing campaigns of World War II.Â S. Maria im Kapitol, interior ; When the archbishop of Cologne resided within the city, he celebrated the first of three Christmas masses at S. Maria im Kapitol and gave communion to the women of this chapter. This remained the tradition up until 1269. In exchange, the abbess provided the archbishop with a mule, and the prioress gave him a silk purse with three gold pieces. The deaconess provided him with a pair of gloves, and the nun in charge of the treasury gave him a candle. He then travelled toÂ S. Caecilia, where he performed the second Christmas mass, before returning to the cathedral, where the third and final mass was performed. The chapter possessed spiritualities in several chapels, including the chapel of Martin, the Notburgis chapel, the Eulogius chapel, and chapels dedicated to Saint Stephan, Saint Nicolaus, and Saint Benedict. In 1230 Abbess Gerberga decided that the chapel of Saint Martin would no longer be served by a canon of the community, but rather by a secular canon.

Premonstratensian (Norbertine) Nunnery “zum Weiher” 
(also “Weyer”, “ad Lacum”, “St. Maria im Weiher”, “Unserer Lieben Frau zum Weiher”)

1.  Foundation and Legal Status  
• 1198 – Rigmudis (Rigmud(is), widow of the Cologne patrician Gerhard, son of Theoderich der Vogt) donates her entire fortune and the family house “am Weiher” to establish a convent for women.  
• Archbishop Adolf I von Berg confirms the foundation and entrusts spiritual direction (cura animarum) to the abbot of the nearby Premonstratensian abbey of Knechtsteden.  
• Rigmudis and her three daughters enter at once: the daughters as choir-nuns (canonissae), Rigmudis herself probably as a conversa or lay-sister.  
• Temporalities (administration of rents, property, servants) remain in the hands of the community; only visitation and sacramental ministry come from Knechtsteden.

2.  Name Variants and Location  
• Medieval charters switch between “monasterium in Weiher”, “domus ad lacum”, “monasterium Beatae Mariae in Weyer/Weiher”, “conventus sanctimonialium ad Wier”.  
• The site lay just outside the west-south-west corner of the medieval city wall of Cologne, between today’s Hahnenstraße and the later Cäcilienstraße; the district was full of small fish-ponds (Weiher = pond) that gave the house its name.  
• After 1300 the neighbourhood is often called “an den Weyerhöfen / Auf’m Weier”; in early-modern cadastral plans the cloister block is labelled “Jungfrauen-Kloster zum Weier”.

3.  Social Composition  
• Of the 44 sisters traceable for the 13th–14th c., 39 belong to Cologne’s Rats- or Schöffen-geschlechter (patrician families).  
• The convent served as a typical “family foundation” for the urban elite: a place to place surplus daughters, safeguard dowries, and secure memorial masses for the dynasty.  
• After c. 1350 the intake widens: a few country knights’ daughters and two bourgeois citizens from nearby Neuss appear in the necrology.

4.  Economy and Everyday Life  
• Core endowment: the large patrician house and adjacent gardens, urban rents on 20+ plots in the parish of St. Cäcilien, and vineyards on the Vorgebirge near Brühl.  
• Fish-ponds supplied Friday fare; a small grange at Longerich produced grain and hay.  
• Income was supplemented by admitting up to seven Beguines, first documented in the 1262 contract you cite (Mechthildis, Aleidis, Elisabeth + four future sisters and one maidservant). The Beguines paid an entry fee and annual rent but lived under the convent’s rule.  
• Liturgical observance followed the Premonstratensian women’s use: full Divine Office in choir, but the convent remained enclosed; Mass and confession were done by priests from Knechtsteden or later a resident chaplain.

5.  Later History  
• 14th–15th c. – modest prosperity; the fifteenth-century Weiher-Copiar (Stadtarchiv Köln, Best. Karton 33) was compiled to safeguard title-deeds after several fires had damaged the archive.  
• 1474/75 – during the Burgundian siege of Cologne the cloister is briefly used as a field hospital.  
• 1550s – discipline visitation by the Cologne provincial of the Premonstratensians notes only ten professed nuns; recruitment from patriciate is ebbing.  
• 1636 – plague kills four sisters; convent never fully recovers in numbers.  
• 1802 – French secularisation: only five canonesses still resident; property confiscated and sold, buildings later demolished (today roughly the block between Cäcilienstraße / Leonhard-Tietz-Str. / Neumarktpassage).

6.  Relationship with Knechtsteden  
• Knechtsteden supplied confessors, held annual canonical visitation and received a small “recognition” payment of wax and wine.  
• Weiher remained otherwise autonomous; election of a prioress (priorissa) required only notification, not confirmation, by the abbot.

7.  Why It Can Be Hard to Find  
• Because the house never bore a saint’s name (like “St. Maria Himmelfahrt”), catalogues sometimes file it under “Köln, Weiherkloster”.  
• Other spellings: Wygher, Weier, Weyer, Wier.  Modern lists often miss it because it disappeared before the 19th-century monastic revivals and left no spectacular ruins.

In short: “Weiher” (Weyer) was a small but influential Norbertine canonesses’ house just outside medieval Cologne, founded 1198 by the patrician Rigmudis and her daughters, supervised spiritually by Knechtsteden Abbey, populated almost exclusively by the city’s ruling families, and dissolved under French rule in 1802.";FAUX

Reginbirg, the daughter of the knight, Gerrich, founded the community (Hauck, 550). According to Kramer, this community was founded circa 870 and lasted until circa 919. In 922 Hermann I, the archbishop of Cologne, combined it with the convent of 11000 virgins before the doors of the city of Cologne. The church was burned by the Hungarians, and a portion of the nuns with the abbess, Lantfuint, were taken in by the convent in the city. A portion of the nuns remained in the old location. In 970 a new convent situated on the former location was built; this convent was closely connected to the archepiscopal church in Cologne (Heineken, 44). This second female community lasted until 1806. ; In the unification of the two convents, Gerresheim was represented by the advocate, Everwin, who was a brother of the abbess (Heineken, 44).

• a Frauenstift of Secular Canonesses (Damenstift) from the early 11th c. until its abolition in 1803.  
• the women were canonissae: they sang the Divine Office but took no perpetual vows of poverty or enclosure and could retain private property or leave to marry.  

Chronological outline  
870 Benedictine nunnery founded by the Frankish noble Gerricus (Gerrich) and his wife Adelheid, dedicated to St Margaret and St Hippolytus.  
900 King Zwentibold of Lotharingia confirms extensive estates on the Lower Rhine.  
c. 1016 The Benedictine nuns are replaced by a chapter of secular canonesses—partly to attract noble families and new endowments.  
1180-1220 Re-organisation by Archbishop Engelbert I of Cologne (who was simultaneously Count of Berg); fixed number of prebends (usually 12-18).  
13th-15th c. Period of greatest wealth; the settlement around the abbey grows into a small fortified market-town that nevertheless remains under the abbess’s jurisdiction.  
1368 In the Jülich–Berg feud Gerresheim is burned; the abbey church survives, but the canonesses finance the rebuilding of the town wall.  
1475-1497 Late-medieval reform: statutes tightened dress-code, reduced the number of servants per canoness to three, and required common refectory meals on fast days.  
1559 Canonesses accept Lutheran preaching for two years during the Bergisch Reformation attempt, but return to Catholic observance in 1567.  
1803 Secularised by the Napoleonic “Reichsdeputations­hauptschluss”; at that moment the chapter counts 8 canonesses and 3 novices.

MEDIEVAL ACTIVITIES (c. 11th-15th centuries)

1. Divine Office and Memorial Culture  
• Eight canonical Hours plus conventual Mass sung daily in the Romanesque abbey church (today St. Margareta).  
• Special vigils for the founders Gerricus & Adelheid and an annual “All Souls of the House of Berg” service.  
• Pilgrimage attraction: the Gerresheim Cross, a large Romanesque reliquary crucifix (c. 1020); feast-day processions through the town drew lay crowds and alms.

2. Estate and Financial Administration  
• Core patrimony: about thirty villages and single farms between the Rhine and the Bergisches Land (Eller, Unterbach, Hilden, Lierenfeld, Hubbelrath).  
• Manorial income: tithes of grain and wine, fishponds on the Düssel, woodland rights, three water-mills and a ferry toll on the Rhine at Himmelgeist.  
• Each canoness held a prebend of ~25–30 “Malter” (hectolitres) of grain in rent; she or her steward travelled on “Zinsfahrten” to collect it.  
• The chapter leased out most demesne land for money-rents from the 14th c. onward, becoming a significant regional creditor.

3. Local Lordship & Justice  
• Until 1368 the abbess was Vogt (lord) of the entire settlement: she appointed the town magistrate, ran the high and low courts and drew the fines.  
• She minted a small bracteate coin in the 12th c. and held a weekly market (Thursday) and two annual fairs (St Margaret, 13 July; Exaltation of the Cross, 14 September).  
• Canonesses sat with the abbess to hear civil cases, issue safe-conducts and confirm guild statutes for the Gerresheim weavers.

4. Education & Literary Work  
• A cloister-school (Schola puellarum) for 8–10 noble girls taught psalm-chant, Latin reading, basic reckoning and courtly French; many pupils later sought entry as canonesses.  
• Small scriptorium copied service books; an illuminated Gerresheim Gospels (c. 1150, in Düsseldorf University Library) carries colophons by the canoness Ida.  

5. Charity & Pastoral Outreach  
• Maintained the hospital of St Johann vor dem Tore (eight beds, a priest-rector, two lay sisters).  
• Distributed weekly bread and pea-soup to 24 poor households; on Maundy Thursday the abbess washed the feet of twelve widows and gave each a silver Pfennig.  
• Supplied chaplains for six dependent parishes; in plague years (1349, 1483) opened a lazar-hut on abbey land at Morp.

6. Interaction with Regional Politics  
• As kin of the counts of Berg, several abbesses mediated feuds between Berg, Jülich and Cologne (records of 1231, 1276, 1338).  
• Provided hospitality for travelling bishops and imperial envoys; in 1249 King William of Holland spent Easter week at Gerresheim and confirmed the abbey’s privileges.  
• In times of war the abbess pledged to supply 12 armoured men to the count’s retinue; the chapter paid scutage instead whenever possible.

7. Domestic & Social Life inside the Stift  
• Each canoness kept a private half-timbered house (Klausurhaus) within the precinct, furnished at her own cost, with 1–3 maids, sometimes a personal chaplain.  
• Diet: meat allowed except on fast-days; wine from the abbey’s Moselle vineyards shipped in barrels to Düsseldorf harbor.  
• Recreation: hawking in abbey woods, playing dice on winter evenings (statutes limit stakes to 3 Heller!).  
• Younger canonesses frequently left to marry; exit fees (“Gnadengelder”) were paid back in instalments from their prebend revenue.

8. Building & Artistic Patronage  
• 11th-13th c.: construction of the three-aisled basilica and a two-storey westwork.  
• 1295: lavish enamelled châsse for St Margaret’s relic, ordered from a Cologne goldsmith.  
• 1420-60: Gothic cloister walk and new residential wing (propstei).  
• Commissions to local sculptors for choir-stalls, misericords and donor-portraits (many still in situ).

Impact  
Throughout the Middle Ages Stift Gerresheim was both a spiritual centre for the eastern Lower Rhine and an economic-political player: its canonesses managed considerable estates, educated generations of high-born women, dispensed charity, and negotiated in regional power struggles—all while maintaining a liturgical life that anchored the emerging town around them.";FAUX

Chartreuse de la Celle-Roubaud (or sometimes Selle-Roubaud) was indeed a Carthusian monastery. It is a very significant site, particularly due to its association with Saint Roseline.

Here are the key details:

Name: Chartreuse de la Celle-Roubaud (or Chartreuse de Sainte-Roseline).

Order: Carthusian. It was initially a house for monks, but later became a nunnery of the Carthusian order.

Location: Located in Les Arcs-sur-Argens, in the Var department of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France.

Foundation: Founded around 1170 or 1174 (sources vary slightly). The foundation was made on land given by the local nobility.

Dedication: Originally, likely to Notre-Dame (Our Lady), as is typical for Carthusian houses. Its later fame is intrinsically linked to Saint Roseline.

Key Figure: Saint Roseline de Villeneuve (Sainte Roseline):

Born around 1263, she entered La Celle-Roubaud and eventually became its Prioress in 1300.
She was renowned for her piety, asceticism, charity to the poor, and miracles.
She died in 1329. Her body is said to have remained incorrupt, and she was canonized.
The chapel at the site now housing her relics is a major pilgrimage destination.
History:

It functioned as a Carthusian monastery (initially male, then female) for centuries.
It would have faced the same challenges as other monasteries in the region, including periods of war and unrest (like the Wars of Religion).
The monastery was suppressed during the French Revolution (late 18th century).
Current Status:

The site is now home to the Château Sainte-Roseline, a prestigious wine estate.
The Chapelle Sainte-Roseline on the estate is the former monastery chapel. It is a monument historique and is renowned for housing the relics of Saint Roseline in a glass shrine.
The chapel also contains significant modern art, including a mosaic by Marc Chagall and bronze works by Diego Giacometti, commissioned in the 20th century.
Activities in Medieval Times (particularly when it was a nunnery with Saint Roseline):

Life at La Celle-Roubaud would have followed the Carthusian rule, adapted for nuns. The Carthusian nuns followed a similar pattern of life to the monks, with a strong emphasis on solitude and contemplation, but with some modifications.

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei):

Solitary Prayer in Cells: Nuns would spend much of their time in individual cells engaged in private prayer, meditation, and recitation of parts of the Divine Office.
Communal Prayer: They would gather in the chapel choir for Conventual Mass (celebrated by a chaplain priest) and the main hours of the Divine Office.
Manual Labor:

Nuns engaged in manual labor appropriate to their strength and the needs of the community within the enclosure. This could include:
Textile work: Spinning, weaving, embroidery (e.g., for liturgical vestments, altar cloths).
Gardening: Cultivating a small herb or vegetable garden.
Copying manuscripts/Illumination: Some nunneries engaged in this, though perhaps on a smaller scale than male monasteries.
General upkeep of their living quarters.
Lay sisters would have assisted with heavier work and tasks requiring more interaction with the outside world, allowing the choir nuns to maintain their contemplative focus.
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Meditative reading of Scripture and spiritual texts was a core activity.
Spiritual Guidance: The Prioress (like Saint Roseline) would have provided spiritual guidance to the community.
Strict Enclosure and Silence:

Carthusian nuns lived under a strict rule of enclosure.
Silence was maintained for much of the day to foster an atmosphere of prayer.
Asceticism:

A simple, often austere lifestyle, including fasting and abstinence as prescribed by the Rule. Saint Roseline herself was known for her extreme asceticism.
Charity (especially during Saint Roseline's time):

While enclosure was strict, monasteries, particularly those with revered figures like Saint Roseline, often found ways to extend charity to the poor and needy in the surrounding area, often through alms distributed at the gate. Saint Roseline was famous for her generosity.
The presence of a figure like Saint Roseline would have made La Celle-Roubaud a significant spiritual center in medieval Provence, attracting pilgrims even during her lifetime due to her reputation for holiness and miracles. Her leadership as Prioress would have deeply shaped the spiritual life of the community.";FAUX

The villas Botbergis and Beslanc in the Gillgau, were presumably part of an inheritance which Adela recieved from her father (Heyen, 40). Apart from the goods in Scriptinas, Anchiriaco, Ursiaco and Caimitas, all the possession had been acquired by the convent previously. Circa 988/993 Bishop Egbert added three vinyards and 19 manses to the possessions at Anchiriaco (Enkirch). After the dissolution of the convent, this property was at least partially loaned out until 1071, when Archbishop Udo restored it to the community (Heyen, 41). At Uerzig the community held a farm and vinyards, as well as tithes from the vinyards. The villa called ""Palatiolum"" is assumed to refer to possessions in the area of Pfalzel. According to Heyen, the term villa could have referred to a village or to a settlement or an economic area which encompassed possessions in several settlements. Heyen believes that the convent did not hold many rights within the area of Pfalzel itself (37). The nuns held vinyards in the areas of Uerzig, Enkirch, and Kaimt-Spei, possibly also in Machern-Wehlen. From the villa Elesa at Enkirch the convent owned a farm, which it rented out in 1291 in return for 10 portions of corn, 5 pounds, 10 chickens, and 1 portion of oatmeal (at this time it was a male community) (Heyen, 48). They also had possessions in Badelingen on the Sauer River and in an area known as Regnemoseht, which has not yet been clearly identified. They held more distant possessions on the Maas and in Gillgau. They also recieved possessions in the region of Walsdorf-Rockeskyll-Stadtfeld, perhaps from a gift given by Irmina, the mother of Adela, at the foundation of the convent sometime towards the end of the seventh century (Heyen, 55). The convent acquired possessions in Nonnweiler, Hinzert, Kesten-Minheim on the Mosel, Ittel, and Britten, perhaps in the mid-ninth century. Land-holdings in Britten, Nonnweiler, and Hinzert can, according to Heyen, did belong to the female community. He believes that the property in these areas was donated to the community by Bishop Hetti (814-847) when two sisters of his, namby the Abess Warentrud and Hulindis, lived at Pfalzel (Heyen, 51). Circa 910 the noble Gottfried gave the convent twelve manses in Dockendorf. At this time, his grandaughter Ratsindis was abbess at the convent. Perhaps in the tenth century, the convent acquired its possessions in Alf and S. Aldegund and a farm in Cond by Cochem. The convent also acquired rights in Ittel. In 988 Abbess Ruothild bestowed on the convent possessions in Ingendorf by Bitburg, which included overlordship over nine families, a total of 35 people (Heyen, 47). During her abbecy, the Archbishop Egbert gave Pfalzel the villa Ehlenz, possessions in Seffern and vinyards in Enkirch. The convent's rights to raw materials and goods in the area of Pfalzel are only known from documents in the fifteenth and sixteenth century (Heyen, 30). Heyen believes the convent held few rights in Pfalzel itself. ; According to Heyen, the material provisions made for the convent were not overwhelmingly large, but were quite sufficient for a small female cloister.";"6158 ; S. Irminen ; The convent was founded circa 700 by Adela, a daughter of Irmina, the co-founder of Echternach and abbess of the convent Oeren in Trier, and of the frankish senchal Hugobert. Adela was a sister of the wife of Pippin, Plectrude (Plektrud), and perhaps also a sister of the bishop of Maastricht-Luettich, Hugobert. A surviving testament, dated to April 1, 732/733, records Adela's confirmation of goods in and around Pfalzel, on the Maas River, and in Gillgau, on the Mosel river, as well as in Bitgau (see assets/property field). The covent itself was established in a late-Roman fortress, which Adela recieved in an exchange with Pippin for unknown property which she held. Before the foundation of the convent, Adela was married, perhaps to Childerich II. It is unclear whether Adela founded the community in conjunction with her husband or on her own initiative. Heyen proposes that she founded the community after the death of her husband and was one of the first to enter the community. Her descendents remained active in the vicinity of Trier and within the church. ; The convent may have served as a stopping place for Anglo-Saxon pilgrims and missionaries, according to Heyen. S. Bonifatius visited Pfalzel in 721. Adela was buried in Pfalzel. From 1207 to 1802 her grave lay in the choir of the Pfalzel convent church. When the chapter was dissolved on September 18, 1802 her grave was moved to the St. Martin-parish church in Pfalzel. ; The record of Abbess Ruothild's gifts to the convent in 988 is the only document still existing from the convent's archives. Although the grave-marker of Ruothild is also extant. ; [1] Heyen, Franz-Josef. Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Benediktinerinnenklosters Pfalzel bei Trier (ca. 700-1016). Goettingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1966. ; [Letter to Adolana, abbess of Pfalzel] ; Following Adela, the abbesses of the community were: Bobila, who lived in the convent for 13 years and 6 months; and Warentrud, who governed the convent for 42 years and 3 months (d. circa 850) (her sister Hulindis lived with her as a nun in Pfalzel); later, Ratsindis (circa 910), whose grandfather donated property to the convent, and Abbess Ruothild (circa 988; died circa 1000). ; Heyen believes that the nuns of Pfalzel erected a parish church in Nonnweiler, because of the unusual dedication of the church to S. Hubertus (Heyen, 52). ; Income for the community presumably came from its land holdings, vinyards, and tithes. ; Benedictine ; The convent was located on the site of Roman ruins on the west-side of the Mosel River near Pfalzel. ; The covent itself was established in a late-Roman fortress. In the south-east corner of the rectangular building-complex, a large room was converted into a church. ; In 1016 the convent was dissolved by the archbishop Poppo, who established another male chapter at Pfalzel. An overwhelming portion of the possessions of the convent were given to the newly-established chapter. According to the Archbishop Poppo, the nuns had been driven to wickedness, on account of which he had to restore the community himself. Heyen believes that the possessions of the convent of Pfalzel were loaned to the ministerial families and that this dissipation of Pfalzel's goods occurred within the context of the dispute between the archbishop and Provost Adalbero of S. Paulin (Heyen, 22-24). Heyen believes the dissolution of the convent resulted from political motives, but was probably also influenced by the ecclesiastical reform movement (Heyen, 24-25). The nuns resisted efforts to change their habits (clothing) and lifestyle. ; Circa 885, Gottfried, the grandfather of Abbess Ratsindis, gave the convent 12 manses in Drugundorf. Circa 988/89 Archbishop Egbert bestowed on the convent the villa Elesa and vinyards in Enkirch. The Abbess Ruothild gave the convent the villa Emendadesdorf in 998/89. ; Heyen believes that during the dispute between the Provost Adalbero of S. Paulin and the Archbishop Poppo, the convent of Pfalzel was reduced (more or less) to a dependency of S. Paulin. ; Adela became the first abbess. Heyen believes that the first nuns may have come from the communities of Oeren in Trier (Ã–ren), Nivelles and Andenne, because of Pfalzel's close links to these communities. ; The core of the convent's church remains and has been restored in recent years. ; There are references to relationships between the communities of Nivelles, Andenne, and Oeren (Ã–ren) with Pfalzel. In her testament, Adela placed Pfalzel under the rule of the bishops of Trier and under the protection (defensio et mundiburgio) of the cathedral church and the bishop. The most that can be definitely determined, however, is that the community had close ties to the bishop himself or to the chapter at S. Paulin. The proximity of possessions owned by the convent of Pfalzel and the chapter of St. Paulin, leads Heyen to assert that already in the ninth century, the two communities had a close relationship. After their expulsion, some of the nuns from Pfalzel went to the neighboring convent of Oeren (Heyen, 69). ; At the time of its foundation and continuing into the ninth century, the convent had ties to the leaders of the Empire. The convent also had close ties to the ministerial families in the surrounding area (Heyen, 44). ; The testament of Adela (732/733) is not the original foundation charter, but a expanded renewal of her earlier bequests to the convent. (see assets/property field) Much of the information about the female convent of Pfalzel comes from a document known as the ""Libellus de rebus Trevirensibus,"" which exists not in the original but in a transcript from the twelfth or thirteenth century. It is from this document that researchers have surmised that Dagobert had three daughters, Regentrud, Irmina and Adela (the connection to Dagobert is a misreading dating to this twelfth-century copy). Irmina founded the convent of Oeren; Adela founded Pfalzel (Heyen, 62). This twelfth century copy refers to three nuns, Ida, Aleith, and Claricia as having written the document. Although scholars have assumed these three nuns came from the convent of Oeren, Heyen believes the manuscript was produced late in the eleventh century by the canons at S. Paulin (Heyen, 72). The document records the testament of Adela. The document also lists the names of four abbesses and a nun. This twelfth-century copy clearly relied on earlier documents (now lost).";FAUX

Fondée en 1150 en tant que dépendance de Sainte-Catherine du Mont, elle est érigée en abbaye à la fin du Moyen Âge. À la suite de la Réforme calviniste, l'abbaye est tout d'abord pillée puis définitivement fermée en 1538.

Situation
L'abbaye est située à environ six cents mètres au nord-est du village de Perrignier, au bord de la ligne de chemin de fer dite « du Tonkin », à moins d'un kilomètre au sud-ouest de la montagne de la Maladière et à environ cinq kilomètres au sud-est du lac Léman[3].

Historique
Fondation
L'abbaye est fondée en 1150[1] par les moniales de Sainte-Catherine du Mont, abbaye située dans une combe du Semnoz, juste au-dessus d'Annecy[4].

Moyen Âge
La fondation reste tout d'abord modeste, gardant un statut de prieuré de la fondation jusqu'à la fin du XIIIe siècle. À ses débuts, le prieuré dépend de l'abbaye d'Aulps, même après son élévation canonique. En 1443, elle passe sous la tutelle de l'abbaye de Tamié, qui conserve la meilleure réputation de toutes les abbayes cisterciennes de Savoie, d'une part, et qui gère directement ou indirectement toutes les communautés cisterciennes féminines de la région, d'autre part[5].

L'abbaye est favorisée par les comtes de Savoie, notamment Amédée VIII et sa femme Marie de Bourgogne. Amédée VIII y effectue d'ailleurs des travaux de réparation[6]. Elle accueille notamment de nombreuses jeunes filles nobles[7]. Cependant, le relâchement de la règle est très sensible dans la deuxième partie du XVe siècle, ce qui vaut les réprimandes de la duchesse Yolande[5].

La fermeture de l'abbaye
L'abbaye est pillée lors de l'occupation du Chablais par les Bernois en 1536[7],[8]. Cependant, les religieuses sont encore en place en janvier 1538[9]. L'abbaye est définitivement fermée par les troupes protestantes en 1538[5].";FAUX

The Commandry is located in the municipality of Bardonnex.

History
The village of Compesières existed since the 12th Century and was also mentioned as the family name of the local noble family.[1] In 1270 the Bishop of Geneva, Aymo of Menthonay, granted the village church to the Order of Saint John. They then expanded the church into a Commandery. It is likely that the oldest parts of the castle date from this period.[2] The current castle was built in the 15th Century. It was used by the Order as a hospice for pilgrims, hospital and a military saltpeter factory.[3] In 1536, during the Protestant Reformation, the Commandry was stripped from the Order. The order returned to the castle in 1564,[2] but it was held by the Protestant leaders of Geneva and Bern until a treaty between Geneva and Savoy returned it completely in 1598.[4]

The order continued to hold the Commandry until the 1882, when it was transferred to the municipality of Bardonnex. In 1955, the municipality gave one of the rooms in the castle to the Order of Malta to build a museum.[3]";

However, historical records indicate that there was also a Dominican nunnery (Dominikanerinnenkloster) in or very near Gotteszell. It seems to have been a smaller and perhaps less prominent institution than the Cistercian abbey, but it did exist.

Here's what we can piece together about a Dominican nunnery in Gotteszell during medieval times:

Foundation and Context:

Likely Foundation: The Dominican nunnery at Gotteszell was probably founded in the 13th century, the period when the Dominican Order was rapidly expanding and establishing communities for women.
Relationship with the Cistercian Abbey: Its proximity to the powerful Cistercian Abbey of Gotteszell is significant. The Cistercian abbey might have played a role in its foundation, perhaps providing land or initial support. It's also possible that the nunnery developed from an earlier, less formal community of religious women that sought affiliation with the Dominican Order.
Rural Setting: Unlike many Dominican nunneries situated in urban centers, Gotteszell was in a more rural, forested area. This would have influenced its resources and daily life.
Spiritual Care: The nuns would have been under the spiritual guidance of Dominican friars, who would travel to provide Mass, confession, preaching, and theological instruction. The nearest significant Dominican friary might have been some distance away (e.g., in Regensburg or Straubing).
Life of the Dominican Nuns in Gotteszell:

Rule of St. Augustine and Dominican Constitutions: Their life would be governed by these, emphasizing contemplative prayer, community life, and the pursuit of truth (Veritas).
Contemplative Prayer (Primary Focus):
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanted in choir at set times.
Daily Mass.
Mental Prayer and Meditation.
Study: Dominican nuns engaged in spiritual reading (Scriptures, Church Fathers, Dominican spiritual writers).
Manual Labor: Essential for sustenance, especially in a rural setting.
Textile Work: Spinning wool or flax (common in rural areas), weaving.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for vegetables, herbs (for food and simple medicines).
Manuscript Work: Possible, though perhaps on a smaller scale than in larger urban convents.
Other domestic tasks like baking.
Poverty and Enclosure:
They would live under vows of poverty, relying on alms and the produce of their labor or any endowments they had.
Strict enclosure within the monastery walls.
Community Life: Governed by a Prioress.
Challenges and Local Significance:

Isolation: Its rural location might have presented challenges in terms of resources and consistent access to Dominican friars for spiritual support.
Economic Viability: Smaller, rural nunneries often faced greater economic struggles than well-endowed urban ones.
Spiritual Presence: The nunnery would have provided a spiritual focus for the local population in the Gotteszell area, complementing the role of the Cistercian abbey.
Later History and Dissolution:

The history of this particular Dominican nunnery in Gotteszell seems to be less extensively documented than that of the Cistercian abbey or major urban Dominican convents.
Many smaller nunneries in rural areas faced difficulties and were sometimes dissolved or amalgamated even before the major upheavals of the Reformation or the 19th-century secularizations.
It appears the Dominican nunnery at Gotteszell was dissolved relatively early, possibly by the 15th or 16th century, perhaps due to economic hardship, declining vocations, or the impact of local reforms or consolidation efforts. Its properties might have been absorbed by the Cistercian Abbey of Gotteszell or other ecclesiastical institutions. This means it likely did not survive into the period of the major Secularization in Bavaria (1803).
In summary, while the Cistercian Abbey is the dominant historical religious institution in Gotteszell, a Dominican nunnery also existed there for a period during the medieval era. It would have been a community of women dedicated to the Dominican ideals of prayer, contemplation, and study, living an enclosed life in a rural Bavarian setting. Its history seems to have concluded earlier than many other monastic foundations.";FAUX

Localisation
L’abbaye est construite à l'origine sur la rive droite du Doubs au nord de la Boucle qui ceinture le centre historique de Besançon. À partir de 1595 les religieuses sont relogées intra-muros en divers lieux successifs puis dans la rue des Granges au début du XVIIIe siècle[1].

Histoire
Fondation
Une abbaye féminine de l'ordre de Citeaux est fondée en 1226 dans le village de Battant qui se trouvait alors hors-les-murs de la ville actuelle. Ce village était lui-même fortifié et ceint de remparts dès le XIIe siècle alors que le pont romain de Battant constituait le seul accès de Besançon avec la rive droite du Doubs depuis l'Antiquité. Les familles de vignerons y représentaient plus de la moitié de la population locale, faisant de la viticulture l'activité principale de la région.

Déplacement intra-muros
Devant les menaces liées aux guerres de Religion et aux conflits entre la France et le Saint-Empire le monastère est démantelé en 1595 et les religieuses relogées intra-muros en divers lieux successifs avant sa réimplantation dans la rue des Granges au début du XVIIIe siècle. La chapelle du couvent est construite sur les plans de dom Perrod, abbé général des cisterciens entre 1714 et 1720 au 59 de ladite rue[2].

À la Révolution française, l'abbaye est pillée et saisie. Le culte n'est plus depuis cette époque pratiqué dans sa chapelle qui a connu divers réemplois : cinéma lors de son inscription elle accueille une librairie depuis novembre 2015.

Here's what is generally known about it:

Full Name: Chartreuse de Notre-Dame de Bertaud (or just Chartreuse de Bertaud).
Order: Carthusian.
Dedication: Notre-Dame (Our Lady, the Virgin Mary), a very common dedication for Carthusian houses.
Location: It was situated in the Dauphiné region of France, specifically in the Alps, near the town of Gap in what is now the Hautes-Alpes department (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region). The isolated, mountainous location is very typical for Carthusian foundations.
Foundation: It was founded around 1188. This places its origins firmly in the medieval period. It was one of the earlier Carthusian foundations after the Grande Chartreuse itself.
History:
Like many monasteries, especially those in mountainous regions, it likely faced challenges from the harsh environment (avalanches, difficult access).
It would have endured through various periods of local conflict and broader European wars. The French Wars of Religion in the 16th century were particularly devastating for many monastic houses in France.
It was suppressed and its assets confiscated during the French Revolution (around 1790-1792), which saw the dissolution of religious orders across France.
Current Status: The monastery is now in ruins. The site is a historical location, and the remains can evoke the isolated and austere life of the monks.
Activities of the Monks at Chartreuse Notre-Dame de Bertaud in Medieval Times:

Being a Carthusian monastery, life at Bertaud would have strictly followed the Carthusian customs (Consuetudines Cartusiae), which were highly eremitical (hermit-like) even within a communal setting:

Prayer and Solitude: The core of their life.

Private Prayer in Cells: Most of their day was spent in individual cells (small houses with a work area and a garden). Here they recited most of the Divine Office, prayed, meditated, and read.
Communal Liturgy: They gathered in the monastery church for Conventual Mass and for certain hours of the Divine Office (e.g., Matins/Lauds and Vespers).
Manual Labor (Ora et Labora):

Within the Cell: Choir monks engaged in manual labor such as gardening in their private plot, woodworking, bookbinding, or other crafts. This was for self-sufficiency, discipline, and to avoid idleness.
Lay Brothers (Conversi): The community would have included lay brothers who handled the more substantial physical labor required to run the monastery: farming any lands the Chartreuse possessed (often limited but necessary for basic sustenance), forestry (given the Alpine location), kitchen work, maintenance, and liaising with the outside world for essential supplies. This allowed the choir monks to maintain their solitude.
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Deep and meditative reading of Scripture, the Church Fathers, and spiritual writings.
Manuscript Copying/Scribing: Like other Carthusian houses, Bertaud would likely have had a scriptorium where monks meticulously copied manuscripts, preserving texts and creating books for their library.
Strict Enclosure and Silence:

Carthusians lived under a severe rule of enclosure, with very limited contact with the outside world.
Silence was a fundamental aspect of their life, observed for most of the day to foster contemplation.
Austere Lifestyle:

Simple diet, often vegetarian, with regular fasts.
Rough, simple habits (clothing).
Minimal comforts.
Limited Community Interaction:

Weekly Walk: A communal walk outside the cloister was usually permitted once a week, during which monks could converse.
Occasional Communal Meals: While most meals were taken alone in the cell, on Sundays and major feast days, they might eat together in the refectory.
Chapter Meetings: For community business, spiritual instruction, and fraternal correction.
In essence, life at Notre-Dame de Bertaud would have been a rigorous pursuit of union with God through prayer, solitude, and asceticism, set against the backdrop of the beautiful but challenging Alpine environment.";FAUX

It is located in the Chartreuse Mountains, north of the city of Grenoble, in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse (Isère), France. History

The monks being forced out of the monastery in April 1903
Originally, the château belonged to the See of Grenoble. In 1084, Saint Hugh gave it to hermit Saint Bruno and his followers who founded the Carthusian Order.

The recipe of the alcoholic beverage Chartreuse is said to have been given to the monks of Grande Chartreuse in 1605[1] by the French Marshal François Annibal d'Estrées. For over a century, the monks worked on perfecting the 130-ingredient recipe. In 1764, the monks expanded their distillery for the first time to meet the demand of their popular Elixir Végétal de la Grande Chartreuse.[2] The distillery has then been moved several times in more remote areas because it represents a major explosion hazard for the surrounding habitations.[1]

The château went through many severe casualties, reconstructions and renovations. The current building was erected in 1688.[3] In 1790, following the French Revolution, the monks were expelled from the monastery, and waited until 1838 to be reauthorized on the premises.[2]

The massive collection of 400 manuscripts and 3,500 printed documents (including 300 incunabula) taken from the Grande Chartreuse during the French Revolution is curated and protected in the bibliothèque d’étude et du patrimoine of Grenoble, and an online scanned version of the documents is available on the digital platform of the library, Pagella, for researchers and interested people alike.[4]

Following the establishment of the Association Law of 1901 and its interpretation that effectively banned religious associations en masse, many notable religious institutions across France, including the Grande Chartreuse, were closed by the French government.[5] While some monks found refuge in Italy until 1929,[6] others settled in the Tarragona region of Spain and relaunched the monastery's famous liqueur-producing activity. The Grande Chartreuse was sold in 1927 to a group of local entrepreneurs who invited the monks back to their monastery.[2]

In 1940, the Grande Chartreuse was reopened under the Petain regime.[7] At the end of World War II, the Grande Chartreuse was used as a hospital by the Allied Forces.";

Full Name: Chartreuse Sainte-Marie-Madeleine de Prémol (or simply Chartreuse de Prémol).
Order: Carthusian (for nuns - Chartreusines).
Location: Situated in the commune of Vaulnaveys-le-Haut, near Grenoble, in the Isère department (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region), in the historical region of Dauphiné, France. Its location in the foothills of the Belledonne mountain range provided the characteristic Carthusian solitude.
Foundation: Founded around 1234.
Founders: Traditionally, its foundation is attributed to Béatrice de Montferrat (wife of André Dauphin/Guigues VI of Viennois) and/or Marguerite de Bourgogne (mother of André Dauphin/Guigues VI). The Dauphins of Viennois were significant patrons of the Carthusian order.
Dedication: To Saint Mary Magdalene (Sainte Marie-Madeleine).
Significance:
Prémol was one of the earliest and most important Carthusian nunneries.
It became a model for other Chartreusine houses and held a certain prestige within the order.
It received considerable patronage from the nobility of the Dauphiné.
History:
The nuns lived a life of strict enclosure, silence, prayer, and manual labor according to the Carthusian rule, adapted for women.
The monastery experienced periods of prosperity and also challenges, including fires and the general vicissitudes of the region.
It was suppressed during the French Revolution (around 1792). The nuns were dispersed, and the property was sold as national goods.
Current Status:
The monastery is now in ruins.
The site is historically significant, and some remnants of the buildings (foundations, wall fragments) can still be seen, evoking its past.
It's a place that attracts hikers and those interested in local history.
Activities of the Carthusian Nuns at Prémol in Medieval Times:

The life of the Chartreusines at Prémol would have been characterized by:

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei):

Spending most of their time in individual cells for private prayer, meditation, and recitation of the Divine Office.
Gathering in the conventual church for Conventual Mass (celebrated by a chaplain priest) and for parts of the Divine Office chanted in common.
Manual Labor (Ora et Labora):

Engaging in manual labor within their enclosure, such as textile work (spinning, weaving, embroidery), gardening, and manuscript work (copying, illumination, though perhaps on a smaller scale than some male houses).
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Meditative reading of Scripture and spiritual texts.
Receiving spiritual guidance from their Prioress and chaplains.
Strict Enclosure and Silence:

Adhering to a very strict rule of enclosure and maintaining silence for most of the day to foster contemplation.
Austere Lifestyle:

Living a simple, ascetic life with a plain diet, fasting, and minimal material comforts.
Chartreuse de Prémol stands as a testament to the rigorous spiritual life of Carthusian nuns in the medieval period and their significant place within the order.";FAUX

Identity and religious order
• Founded 27 November 1121 by Saint Norbert of Xanten himself, together with Count Godfrey of Namur and his wife Ermensende.
• It was the second permanent house of the Premonstratensian Order (hence “Norbertines” or “White Canons”) after the mother-abbey of Prémontré near Laon.
• Its members were canons regular, not monks: they followed the Rule of St Augustine, added the Premonstratensian liturgical and disciplinary statutes, and combined a quasi-monastic life with active pastoral ministry in the surrounding parishes.

Growth in the High Middle Ages (1121-c.1350)
• Very rapid endowment: by 1150 the abbey held some 40 square km of demesne land in the Sambre and Meuse valleys, tithes in fifteen parishes, and toll exemptions on the Sambre river granted by Emperor Frederick I (1159).
• Daughter-houses: Floreffe acted as mother-abbey for at least sixteen new Premonstratensian foundations, among them Postel (1137), Leffe (1152), Soleilmont (c.1185, women), Beaurepart in Liège (c.1192) and, outside the Low Countries, Dommartin in Lorraine (1171).
• Church and buildings: a large stone abbey-church (1124-1182) with a triple-apsed east end, consecrated by Pope Lucius III in 1182. A cloister, chapter-house and infirmary were finished before 1200; inner court, barns and guest-house by 1250.

Intellectual and artistic life
• Scriptorium active from the 1130s to the 14th c. Its masterpiece is the giant two-volume “Floreffe Bible” (British Library Add. MS 17737-38, c.1160-70) with 74 historiated initials.
• A studium (school) for the order’s clerics is attested by 1190; a small library catalogue of 1315 lists 203 volumes in theology, canon law and the classics (including Terence, Ovid, Boethius).
• Liturgical music: several 13th-c. Premonstratensian antiphonaries copied at Floreffe survive in Namur and Liège.

Economic and social activities in the Middle Ages
Agriculture & granges
– About twelve outlying granges (farms) run by conversi brothers or hired laymen raised grain, flax, cattle and—on the sandy soils around Postel and Fagne—sheep.
– Two water-mills on the Sambre (attested 1189, 1246) and a riverside wharf for timber and stone.
Hospitality
– A hospice for boatmen and pilgrims dedicated to St James (document of 1208). Guest-house routinely hosted travelling Premonstratensians en route between Prémontré and the Rhineland.
Pastoral care
– Floreffe’s canons served at least nine dependent parish churches; papal bulls of 1178 and 1216 confirm their right to collect great tithes while providing priests and sacraments to the laity.
Almsgiving & infirmary
– Annual distribution of bread on the vigil of the Assumption (statutes of Abbot Gossuin, 1235). An infirmary wing treated both brethren and poor lay-folk “pro Deo” three days a week.
Brewing & viticulture
– A small hop-garden (mention 1282) and an abbey brewery by 1366; this medieval brewing tradition is the remote forerunner of the modern “Floreffe” beers produced commercially since 1983.

Late-medieval crises and resilience
• Plague of 1349 and the Liège-Namur wars (1360-75) cut the community from c.60 to c.35 canons.
• Fire of 1463 destroyed dormitory and cloister roofs; rebuilt under Abbot Jean d’Orjo (1464-88).
• Iconoclastic Fury (1566) and the opening campaigns of the Dutch Revolt (1568-74) caused only minor losses; the abbey lay within the Spanish-held Namur citadel zone and was protected by garrison troops.

Early-modern decline and suppression
• 17th-18th c.: community stabilized around 25-30 canons; baroque remodeling of church façade (1623-30) and interior (1770s).
• French Revolutionary occupation: abbey seized 1794, canons expelled 1796, property sold 1797. Most manuscripts went to the University Library at Liège; the church furnishings were dispersed.
• Buildings bought by the diocese of Namur (1819) and turned into a minor seminary (from 1837 a collège still operating today).

The site today
• Surviving medieval fabric: lower walls of the 12th-c. church (nave length 70 m), chapter-house with five-bay rib vaults (c.1170), portions of the east range and 13th-c. cellars.
• Later additions form a vast quadrangle dominating the Sambre valley; the whole complex is protected as a historic monument and open to visitors, with museum rooms devoted to Premonstratensian art and the Floreffe Bible (facsimile).
• Although no Premonstratensian community resides there, a handful of Norbertine canons from Leffe celebrate the order’s feast each 6 June in the abbey-church, symbolically linking the site to its original vocation.

In short, Floreffe was one of the earliest and most influential Premonstratensian abbeys. During the Middle Ages it combined a rigorous canonical life with agricultural enterprise, pastoral service, scholarship and hospitality, acted as mother-house for many other Norbertine communities, and left us important architectural and manuscript treasures before its suppression under the French Republic.";FAUX

Cette abbaye était modeste, comparée à ses voisines prestigieuses comme l’Abbaye de Bonne-Espérance ou l’Abbaye d’Aulne : elle n’y compta guère que de 20 à 30 sœurs suivant les époques.

Comme les ruines se situaient au cœur de la forêt de Mariemont rachetée en 1829 par la Société de Mariemont, il n’est donc pas étonnant que cette dernière ait acquit l’essentiel des ruines et des terrains environnants pour y construire cet ensemble idéalement situé à proximité des fosses déjà citées. A la fin de l’exploitation charbonnière, ces maisons furent vendues à des particuliers, souvent d’anciens mineurs.

A l’initiative de Raoul Warocqué, des fouilles furent menées dans les années 1890 sur le site de l’ancienne abbaye et mirent à jour de nombreuses tombes et d’autres objets qui actuellement se trouvent dans le parc de Mariemont dans l’ancienne orangerie.

D’autres fouilles furent de nouveau menées dans les années 2000 à l’initiative du Cercle d’Histoire et d’Archéologie de Morlanwelz dont certaines découvertes sont exposées au Prieuré de Montaigu et de nouveau à Mariemont.

L’abbaye de l’Olive, ses légendes. 
La légende de Gillion de Trazegnies 
Résumé d’un roman anonyme bourguignon en prose du XVème siècle dont il existe plusieurs versions et adaptations. Le romancier, passant par l’abbaye de l’Olive en Hainaut, s’arrête devant trois tombes pareilles et qui se touchent ; là il apprend, par un moine, les aventures de Gillion de Trazegnies lesquelles seront, selon lui, agréablement écoutées par Philippe duc de Bourgogne. Gillion était un chevalier de la cour du comte du Hainaut dont la cousine, Marie, était son épouse. Son vœu d’avoir un héritier étant enfin exaucé, il réalisa la promesse qu’il avait faite de partir aux croisades. Sur le chemin du retour de Terre sainte, il est fait prisonnier par le sultan d’Égypte. Sur le point d’être exécuté, il est remarqué par la fille du souverain, Gracienne. Cela lui valut quelques jours de répit pendant lesquels il se fit apprécier : il libéra en effet le souverain d’Égypte fait prisonnier à son tour par un rival. Les années passèrent, de nombreux faits glorieux s’accumulèrent. Un jour, un seigneur fourbe, qui n’avait d’autre intérêt que de conquérir le cœur de Marie, rencontra Gillion et lui annonça que son épouse et son héritier étaient tous deux morts. Se croyant libéré, Gillion épousa alors Gracienne bien décidé qu’il était de rester en Égypte. Cependant, en Hainaut, Marie avait donné naissance à des jumeaux, Jean et Gérard et ils se portaient tous à merveille. Devenus adultes les frères se décidèrent de rechercher leur père. Après divers faits d’armes, comme la délivrance de l’île de Chypre, les deux frères retrouvèrent leur père et lui apprirent que Marie l’attendait toujours. Après un passage par Rome, où Gracienne fut baptisée, la petite famille arriva en Hainaut. Malgré l’embarras de la situation, Marie fit bon accueil à Gillion et à la sarrasine qui malgré tout avait sauvé la vie à son cher époux. Les deux femmes se retirèrent à l’abbaye de l’Olive et Gillion à l’abbaye de Cambron. Rappelé par le sultan d’Égypte, il consentit à repartir mais fut mortellement blessé lors d’un combat. Son cœur rapporté en Hainaut, fut déposé, dans la tombe qu’il avait fait préparer, entre ses deux femmes. La légende du chevalier bigame était née … L’illustration ci-dessus provient du livre de Bayot et représenterait la pierre tombale d’un chevalier bigame associé à la légende de Gillion dans une version allemande. Elle se trouverait dans la cathédrale d’Erfurt .

Un même tombeau renferma leurs restes, et on montrait encore, avant 1794, à l’abbaye de l’Olive, près de Mariemont, l’effigie du chevalier bigame. Une autre version est quelque peu différente au sujet des deux dames : elles exprimèrent le désir de prendre le voile et entrèrent au monastère de l’Olive et y décédèrent à deux jours d’écart. Gillion ordonna au monastère de faire construire trois grands tombeaux de marbre et de lui réserver celui du centre, car « il voulait gésir au milieu d’elles ».

Sainte Béatrix 
Béatrix était une nonne de l'abbaye de l'Olive qui vécut durant le XIIIème siècle.
Elle se fit d'abord remarquer par une tendre piété envers la Vierge Marie. Nommée cellérière de sa communauté, elle s’éprendra du clerc et certains affirment qu'elle céda à la tentation. La nonne et le jeune homme décidèrent donc de fuir le couvent pour vivre leur histoire d’amour. Au moment de partir, elle s’en remit à la statue de la Vierge et lui remit ses clés. Au couvent, on ne suspecta rien. Elle vécut quatre années dans le « péché » jusqu’au moment où le clerc la chassa de chez lui car il la suspectait d’infidélité. Elle ne sait que faire et craint de mourir en état de péché. Craignant de ne pouvoir reprendre sa vie monastique, elle se renseigne auprès de sœurs du couvent et apprend que la sœur Béatrix faisait l’admiration de sa communauté et qu’elle était en odeur de sainteté. Stupéfaite, elle s'adressa à la Vierge Marie qui lui apparut  pour lui dire qu'elle avait tenu sa place tout le temps de ses infidélités et sauvé sa réputation. Néanmoins, à l’avenir, elle devait  renoncer au péché. Selon la légende, le corps de Béatrix fut enterré à l’Olive et suscita, dès le début du XVIIème siècle,  un pèlerinage qui se déroulait chaque année en date du 6 novembre. Lors de la destruction de l’abbaye, les reliques de la Sainte furent transportées dans l’église de Morlanwelz et le pèlerinage continua jusqu’au milieu du XXème siècle. Le curé de Morlanwelz, Joris, y fit élever une statue due au ciseau de Mathias Zens qui représente Beatrix qui y tient d’une main, les clés du monastère et de l’autre, un petit tableau de la Vierge. 

On n’en sait pas plus sur la véritable identité de cette Beatrix. L’on sait simplement que l’abbaye de l’Olive fut fondée par l’ermite Jean-Guillaume grâce à la bonté de Dame Béatrix, veuve d’Eustache III, seigneur du Roeulx et de Morlanwelz.

2. Life in the Benedictine Nunnery (7th-8th Centuries):
* Rule of St. Benedict: The nuns would have lived according to the Rule, which emphasizes:
* Opus Dei (Work of God): The Divine Office – regular communal prayer and chanting of Psalms throughout the day and night. This was the central focus.
* Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Study of the Scriptures and writings of the Church Fathers. Literacy would be important for this.
* Labora (Manual Work): ""Ora et Labora"" (Pray and Work). For nuns, this would include:
* Textile production: Spinning wool, weaving cloth (for their own garments, liturgical vestments, possibly for sale or trade). This was a very common and important activity for nunneries.
* Gardening: Cultivating vegetables, fruits, and medicinal herbs within the monastic enclosure.
* Household tasks: Cooking, cleaning, baking, mending.
* Scriptorium (possibly): Some nunneries engaged in copying and illuminating manuscripts, though perhaps on a smaller scale than male monasteries. This depended on resources and the literacy/skills of the nuns.
* Community Life: Governed by an Abbess (like St. Landrada). The life would be communal, with shared meals, work, and prayer. Obedience, stability, and conversatio morum (conversion of life) were key Benedictine vows.
* Hospitality: The Rule of St. Benedict places importance on welcoming guests, especially the poor and pilgrims.
* Self-Sufficiency: Monasteries aimed to be largely self-sufficient, supported by the produce of their lands (likely granted at foundation) and their own labor.";FAUX

Parménie was not a distinct, independent Charterhouse named ""Chartreuse de Parménie"" in the same way that, for example, Chartreuse de Vaucluse or Chartreuse de Portes were individual, self-governing Carthusian monasteries.
Instead, Parménie was a very important dependency and pilgrimage site owned and managed by the monks of the Grande Chartreuse (the mother house of the Carthusian order) for many centuries.
Here's a more detailed explanation:

Ancient Sacred Site: Mont de Parménie, located in the Isère department (Dauphiné region of France), has been a place of religious significance since antiquity, possibly pre-Christian. Legend associates it with figures like Saint John of Matha (founder of the Trinitarians), who is said to have lived there as a hermit.

The lands of Parménie, including its chapel and hermitages, came into the possession of the Grande Chartreuse in the 12th century (around 1116).
The Carthusians maintained it as a place of pilgrimage and solitude. It was a place where some monks from the Grande Chartreuse might have sought deeper retreat, or it served as a spiritual outpost.
Pilgrimage and Sœur Louise Hours:

The pilgrimage to Notre-Dame de Parménie was significant. It experienced periods of decline and revival.
A key figure in its revival was Sœur Louise Hours (or Sœur Louise de Parménie), a humble shepherdess who, in the 17th century (around 1660s-1670s), had visions and was instrumental in rebuilding the chapel and reinvigorating the pilgrimage, with the support and under the authority of the Carthusians of the Grande Chartreuse.
Role for the Grande Chartreuse:

Parménie served as a spiritual resource and perhaps a source of some revenue (from pilgrims) for the Grande Chartreuse.
It was considered part of the ""Desert of Chartreuse,"" the wider area of solitude surrounding the mother house.
French Revolution and After:

During the French Revolution, the Carthusians were expelled, and their properties, including Parménie, were confiscated.
The pilgrimage continued in various forms, and other religious communities later established themselves at Parménie in the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., Oblates of Mary Immaculate, various communities of nuns).
In summary:

While you wouldn't find ""Chartreuse de Parménie"" listed as one of the independent daughter houses of the Carthusian order, Parménie was deeply intertwined with the Carthusians for over 600 years. It was a significant possession and pilgrimage site managed by the Grande Chartreuse, rather than a distinct Charterhouse in itself. Its history is rich and layered, with the Carthusian period being a very long and important chapter.";FAUX

L'abbaye cistercienne de Mègemont fut fondée en 1206 par Dauphin, comte d'Auvergne, pour des religieuses. Elle s'affilia à l'abbaye cistercienne de Montpeyroux.
En 1612, les abbesses quittent Mègemont pour permuter avec l'abbaye cistercienne de La Bénisson-Dieu dans la Loire. Dès lors ce furent des hommes religieux qui occupèrent Mègemont. A la Révolution (1793) l'abbaye est vendue comme bien national et devient bâtiment à usage fermier (bergerie et grange à foin). Elle le restera jusqu'au rachat de son église par la commune de Chassagne en 1994 avec son classement comme monument historique.,

Since 2013, it has been linked by two foot-bridges to the historical district Le Panier and to the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations; the latter being the first French national museum to be located outside Paris.

History
Fort Saint-Jean was built on a site earlier occupied by the Military Order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John, from which the new building derived its name. Fort Saint-Nicolas was constructed at the same time on the opposite side of the harbour. Commenting on their construction, Louis XIV said, ""We noticed that the inhabitants of Marseille were extremely fond of nice fortresses. We wanted to have our own at the entrance to this great port.""[1] In fact, the two new forts were built in response to a local uprising against the governor, rather than for the defence of the city: their cannons pointed inwards towards the town, not outwards towards the sea.

Two earlier buildings were incorporated into the structure of the fort: the twelfth century Commandry of the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem, which served as a monastic hospice during the crusades; and the fifteenth century tower of René I, King of Provence.[2]";

Chartreuse de la Salette (or Chartreuse de Sainte-Croix-de-Salettes).

Here's what's known about this Carthusian house:

Name: Chartreuse de la Salette (or Sainte-Croix-de-Salettes). It's important not to confuse this with the 19th-century apparition site of Notre-Dame de La Salette, which is in a different location within the same broader region.
Order: Carthusian.
Location: It was situated near Crémieu, in the Isère department, in the historical region of Dauphiné, France.
Foundation: Founded around 1299 or the early 14th century (some sources say 1308). This makes it a medieval foundation.
Dedication: The ""Sainte-Croix"" (Holy Cross) in one of its names suggests a dedication to the Holy Cross, though Notre-Dame (Our Lady) was also a very common primary dedication for Carthusian houses.
History:
It would have followed the typical austere and contemplative life of the Carthusian order.
It likely suffered, as did many religious houses in France, during periods of conflict such as the Hundred Years' War and especially the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century.
It was suppressed during the French Revolution (late 18th century) when all monastic orders were dissolved and their properties confiscated.
Current Status: The monastery is largely in ruins or its structures have been repurposed or have disappeared. Remnants may exist, but it's not an active monastic site.
Activities of the Monks at Chartreuse de la Salette (near Crémieu) in Medieval Times:

As a Carthusian house, its activities would have been standard for the order:

Solitary Prayer and Contemplation: The cornerstone of Carthusian life, with monks spending most of their time in their individual cells.
Communal Liturgy: Gathering in the monastery church for Conventual Mass and certain parts of the Divine Office (e.g., Matins, Lauds, Vespers).
Manual Labor: Each monk performed manual labor within his cell (e.g., gardening, simple crafts like bookbinding or woodworking) for self-sufficiency and discipline. Lay brothers would have handled heavier work for the community (farming, maintenance, etc.).
Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Deep, prayerful reading and meditation on Scripture and spiritual texts.
Manuscript Copying: Many Charterhouses had scriptoria where monks copied and preserved texts.
Strict Enclosure and Silence: Maintained to foster a contemplative environment.
Austere Lifestyle: Simple food, fasting, basic clothing, and minimal comforts.
In summary:

The Chartreuse de la Salette near Crémieu was a genuine medieval Carthusian monastery. It is crucial to distinguish it from the much more famous 19th-century Marian apparition site of Notre-Dame de La Salette, which is a different location and associated with a different religious order (Missionaries of La Salette).";FAUX

It seems probable that this was the forerunner of St. Jørgen's Hospital (Sankt Jørgens Hospital) which was later associated with the research and treatment of leprosy by Daniel Cornelius Danielssen.[;"History

Prospect over Bergen made in 1740 shows Lungegården, built on the foundations of Nonneseter Abbey
Nonneseter Abbey is first recorded by name in 1262, but was certainly founded many years earlier, possibly in about 1150.[2] It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The nuns apparently belonged to the Cistercian Order, although this is not confirmed until as late as 1494.

It was a prestigious establishment, and several members of the royal family entered the convent. The nuns elected their Abbess themselves, and the Bishop had no right to interfere except if there was a contested election. Few abbesses are known, but an abbess named Cecilia was elected in 1326. It was evidently one of the biggest convents in Norway; in 1320, the convent had 35 nuns, which was a high number even internationally. It was the richest female convent in Norway, and also richer than many of the male convents: the richest convent in Norway was Munkeliv Abbey, which had an income of 2500 lauper, with Nonneseter Abbey of Bergen not far behind at 1700 lauper.

The Nonneseter was severely devastated by the Black Death in Norway in 1349. It appears that the Nonneseter Abbey experienced a downturn after the Black death and during the 15th century. Munkeliv Abbey was devastated by fire in 1455, which caused a crisis for that abbey, which was the most important in Norway. On an unknown date, king Christian I transferred the income, estates and land of Nonneseter to the Munkeliv Abbey to compensate them for the 1455 fire. This was done since the Nonneseter Abbey was almost empty, and the few nuns which remained were moved to an unnamed convent of their order. The buildings were transferred to the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony. It is not known when this happened, only that it must have been during the reign of Christian I (1481-1513). Tradition claims that in 1507, the nuns were ejected for immoral and unseemly behaviour. However, since it is known that the field directly outside of the convent was transformed to a shooting field by the Bishop of Bergen in 1497, the nuns must have disappeared between 1481 and 1497.

The nunnery underwent secularisation in 1528, and the premises were converted into a private fortified residence, under the name of Lungegården, by the new proprietor, Vincens Lunge.[3][4] Cistercian Order – ""Ora et Labora"" (Prayer and Work):

Reformed Benedictines: The Cistercians were a reform movement within the Benedictine tradition, emphasizing a return to the literal observance of the Rule of St. Benedict, with a focus on austerity, simplicity, manual labor, and separation from worldly affairs.
Liturgy and Prayer: This was the primary ""work"" (opus Dei). The nuns would have gathered in their church multiple times a day and night to chant the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours). Daily Mass and private prayer were also central.
Manual Labor: A core tenet. While male Cistercians often worked extensively in agriculture in remote areas, for enclosed nuns in an urban/semi-urban setting like Bergen, labor would include:
Textile Work: Spinning wool (sheep were common in Norway) or flax, weaving cloth for their own habits, bedding, and possibly for sale or trade.
Needlework and Embroidery: Creating and mending their own garments, altar linens, and perhaps more elaborate liturgical vestments if they had skilled members and patrons.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for vegetables, fruits (hardy varieties), and medicinal herbs for their own consumption and use.
Baking: Producing their own bread.
Copying Manuscripts (less common for Cistercian nuns than monks, but possible): If they had literate members and a need for choir books or devotional texts.
General upkeep of the monastery.
Location and Resources (Bergen):

Urban Setting: Nonneseter was located at the foot of Mount Fløyen, near the Vågen bay, initially perhaps slightly outside the main urban core but eventually becoming part of the expanding city of Bergen. This urban setting differed from many remote Cistercian foundations.
Economic Importance of Bergen: Bergen was a major trading port, especially with the Hanseatic League. This meant the abbey:
Could potentially receive donations and bequests from wealthy merchants and nobles.
Might have owned properties within Bergen or agricultural lands further afield, from which they derived income (rents, produce). Cistercians, unlike mendicant orders like the Poor Clares, could own property.
May have engaged in some limited trade of surplus goods they produced (e.g., textiles, perhaps preserved foods from their lands).
Community Life:

Abbess: The community was led by an Abbess, who would have been a significant figure, responsible for both the spiritual and temporal welfare of the monastery.
Enclosure: Cistercian nuns lived an enclosed life, meaning they generally did not leave the monastic precincts, and access for outsiders was restricted. This fostered an environment of prayer and contemplation.
Social Composition: The nuns likely came from Norwegian noble families and the wealthier burgher (merchant) families of Bergen. Monasteries often served as places for unmarried daughters of the elite.
Architecture:

Cistercian architecture is known for its simplicity, austerity, and functionality, avoiding excessive ornamentation. Nonneseter would have had a church, cloister, chapter house, refectory, dormitory, infirmary, and workshops, built in a style reflecting these ideals, likely using local stone.
Very little of the original abbey remains today, though the tower (""Nonneseter tårnet"" or ""Tårnplass"") is a prominent landmark that was part of the complex or its later iterations.
The Reformation and Dissolution:

Nonneseter was one of the wealthiest convents in Norway.
The Protestant Reformation reached Norway (then part of Denmark-Norway) in the early 16th century.
The abbey was dissolved around 1528, somewhat before the official implementation of the Reformation in Denmark-Norway (1536/37). Its properties were confiscated by the Crown.
The buildings were repurposed. The church, for example, was used as a private chapel and later parts of the complex were incorporated into other structures or demolished.
In summary, the Cistercian nuns of Nonneseter Abbey in medieval Bergen lived a structured life of prayer, manual labor, and community within their enclosure. They managed significant properties and played a role in the religious and social life of one of Norway's most important cities, providing a spiritual haven and a place for women from prominent families until the Reformation brought their monastic way of life to an end.";

The Trappist Abbey of Rochefort or Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy, which belongs to the Cistercians of Strict Observance, is located in Rochefort in the province of Namur (Wallonia, Belgium). The abbey is famous for its spiritual life and its brewery, which is one of few Trappist beer breweries in the world. Life in the abbey is characterised by prayer, reading and manual work, the three basic elements of Trappist life. The motto of the abbey is Curvata Resurgo.

History
Early history
Around 1230, Gilles de Walcourt, count of Rochefort founded a monastery for Cistercian nuns called Secours de Notre-Dame. In 1464 Louis de la Marck ordered the nuns to leave the monastery which had decayed and they were replaced by monks. The monastery was the latest Daughter-house of the abbey of Abbey of Cîteaux. During the Eighty Years War the abbey was ravaged by the Protestant armies of the Seventeen Provinces (1568) and the Austrian armies of John of Austria (1577). Around 1595, the first brewery was founded within the abbey.

In the 17th century the abbey suffered from war, famine and the plague. On 30 April 1650, an army from Lorraine, led by baron Châtelet, invaded the abbey. The monks had to flee to Marche, as well as in 1652 and 1653.

In 1789 the French revolutionary army invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and in 1797 the abbey was closed and sold to Lucien-Joseph Poncelet. Poncelet demolished the abbey around 1805 and converted it to a farm. Material of the abbey was used for buildings in Rochefort.";FAUX

Fondée au milieu du XIIe siècle, elle a subsisté jusqu'en 1609. Il n'en reste aujourd'hui que la partie sud, c'est-à-dire surtout l'ancienne chapelle, qui se trouve dans la commune de Corcelles-Ferrières dans le Doubs.

Étymologie
Le terme de Corcelles, qu'on retrouve dans de nombreux toponymes en France, est proche de celui du mot français cour et provient du latin tardif curtis. Avec le diminutif -cella, corticella désigne une petite exploitation agricole. L'abbaye donnera son nom au village de Corcelles qui devient Corcelles-Ferrières au cours du XIXe siècle.

Histoire
Tout à la fin du XIe siècle, dans l'esprit de la réforme grégorienne, Robert de Molesme lance depuis Citeaux la réforme cistercienne, qui se veut un retour à la rigueur de la règle de saint Benoît. Grâce, en particulier, à l'action de saint Bernard, l'ordre va rapidement s'étendre en France et dans toute l'Europe. En 1132, des moniales, installées à Tart sollicitent et obtiennent leur incorporation à l'ordre. C'est la fondation de la branche féminine de l'ordre cistercien qui essaime à son tour avec un décalage de quelques décennies sur la branche masculine. Notre-Dame de Tart est l'abbaye-mère de cette branche féminine. Elle eut une petite vingtaine de filles directes, dont Corcelles.

On ne connaît pas exactement la date de fondation de l'abbaye de Corcelles par des moniales qui se rattachent à Tart mais elle intervient probablement vers 1150[1]. Le document le plus ancien connu et concernant l'abbaye, quoique probablement antérieur[1], date de 1179 : il s'agit d'un acte de donation qui atteste l'existence de l'abbaye à cette date. Les moniales se sont installées, probablement à la demande d'un seigneur local, dans un endroit relativement solitaire de la vallée de l'Ognon, dans un petit val arrosé par un ruisseau et entouré d'épaisses forêts, à toutefois seulement une vingtaine de kilomètres de Besançon. L'abbaye n'est guère éloignée de celle d'Acey, importante communauté de moines cisterciens, même si pas ou peu de liens semblent avoir existé entre ces deux abbayes du même ordre.

En 1185 un autre document, un privilège de Lucius III, donne un état des lieux des possessions de l'abbaye[1]. Celle-ci sont particulièrement maigres, à peine de quoi subvenir aux besoins de la communauté. Le temporel de l'abbaye restera faible pendant toute son histoire. Dans la plupart des documents fiscaux, les biens des moniales ne sont pas estimés à cause de leur pauvreté. Au XIVe siècle, ils équivalent à ceux de petits prieurés ruraux. Les moniales sont en partie issues de la petite noblesse locale. Celles-ci, du moins dans les premiers temps de l'abbaye quand la rigueur de l'ordre était observée, travaillaient directement à leur subsistance, une part importante du temporel étant destinée à l'exploitation directe.

Comme l'ordre cistercien, l'abbaye connaît un déclin à la fin du Moyen-âge. Le monachisme cistercien ne correspond plus à la spiritualité de la Réforme et les religieuses n'observent plus la rigueur de la règle originelle. À Corcelles, les moniales, entrant dans les ordres sans véritable vocation et en obéissant à des politiques familiales, vivent dans la licence et une certaine mondanité. Le peu de biens et le dérèglement conduit en 1609 à la fusion de l'abbaye avec celle d'Ounans, alors située à Dole[1]. Aussi fille de Tart, cette abbaye avait été fondée vers 1140 à Ounans. Plus importante que Corcelles, elle avait dû déménager en 1420 sous la menace de la Loue avant de se déplacer à nouveau en 1520 dans la ville même de Dole.

Peu après, une autre abbaye de moniales cisterciennes, celle de Colonges, fusionne à son tour à Ounans-Dole. Cette fusion entraîne la disparition de certains bâtiments de Courcelles[2]. Ce qui reste est vendu comme bien national sous la Révolution française. Les bâtiments sont alors utilisés comme ferme puis sont rachetés en 1944 pour être restaurés et devenir un musée[2]. L'ancienne église abbatiale, les bâtiments monastiques et les divers vestiges font l’objet d’une inscription au titre des monuments historiques depuis le 31 décembre 1997[2].";FAUX

Fondée en 1208, elle connaît une période de prospérité correspondant au XIIIe siècle, puis un XIVe siècle très difficile, qui les oblige à sa réfugier en milieu urbain

Histoire
Fondation
L'abbaye est fondée en 1208 par Sacristane de Porcelet, la cadette de la maison des Porcellets. Elle reçoit à cette date le fief de Mollégès de la part de Michel de Mouriès, archevêque d'Arles. En 1218, Sacristane se sépare de son mari et devient la seconde abbesse de Mollégès. Les moniales sont au nombre d'une cinquantaine, issues pour la plupart de familles nobles[3]. Déclin
Aux XIVe et XVe siècles, l'abbaye décline, du fait de causes extérieures principalement : les ravages des épidémies (particulièrement peste noire), des guerres et des grandes compagnies (notamment les troupes de Raimond de Turenne[4]) en particulier, les incitent à trouver refuge en ville. L'abbaye est réunie à celle de Sainte-Croix, à Apt. Celle-ci, bénédictine, adopte alors la règle cistercienne[3]. Pour autant, les religieuses conservent l'abbaye de Mollégès, jusqu'au XVIe siècle, date à laquelle les seigneurs laïcs font main basse sur les bâtiments abbatiaux, rebâtissent la façade intérieure en style Renaissance. Jusqu'en 1763, la famille de Châteauneuf-Mollégès possède les bâtiments, qu'elle cède à la mort d'Anne de Châteauneuf en 1763[5]. Les religieuses d'Apt, bénéficiaires à nouveau de cette donation, n'en conservent le fruit que jusqu'à la Révolution française.

Les religieuses viennent de Saint-Pons de Gémenos[4], sous la filiation de laquelle se place la nouvelle fondation.";FAUX

Histoire
Le prieuré ne connut successivement que trois supérieures, car à la suite d'un incendie, les religieuses déménagèrent à Bruxelles, en 1456, gardèrent le prieuré de l'Ermite comme une simple propriété, et poursuivirent la vie communautaire au couvent de Notre-Dame à la Rose Plantée de Jéricho. En 1783, l'empereur Joseph II, en tant que duc de Brabant, supprime officiellement le prieuré de l'Ermite, car considéré comme couvent inutile.

De ce petit prieuré de la forêt de Soignes, il reste une chapelle en pierres du XVe siècle, principalement de style gothique flamboyant, et quelques bâtiments agricoles, à proximité.

Situation géographique
Le minuscule prieuré était jadis situé en lisière de la forêt de Soignes, à l'endroit où deux grands chemins, celui de Nivelles et celui de Genappe, se rejoignaient pour gagner Alsemberg et Bruxelles[2]. Cet endroit figure aujourd'hui au niveau de la commune de Braine-l'Alleud, à 12 km au nord de Nivelles, en Belgique, dans la province du Brabant wallon.

Origine du prieuré
Un acte passé à Gembloux, en 1131, rapporte que le duc de Brabant, Godefroid Ier, et son fils, ont cédé un bien nommé ""Dudinsart"", situé dans la paroisse de Braine-l'Alleud, à l'abbaye de Gembloux. L'endroit est donc occupé, dans un premier temps, par un moine de cette abbaye[2].

Par une ordonnance datée de Bruxelles, le 6 mai 1399, Jeanne, duchesse de Brabant, transfert cette possession, avec ses dépendances, au profit de dix pauvres femmes vivant saintement à Wauthier-Braine. L’évêque de Cambrai, Pierre V, confirme le fait par un acte daté de Mons, le 27 juillet 1399, et autorise ces femmes à prendre l’habit et à fonder un couvent pour vivre selon la règle de saint Augustin. Le prieuré augustinien de Ter Cluysen, autrement dit de l’Ermite, relevant du prieuré de Sept Fontaines, sous Rhode-Saint-Genèse, est ainsi établi.

Le 14 octobre 1437, la seigneurie de l'Estrée (un domaine et un moulin) est adjugée aux religieuses de Ter Cluysen.[réf. nécessaire]

Les trois supérieures du prieuré
Le prieuré de l'Ermite ne connut que trois supérieures[3] à savoir :

Catherine Pijnbroec, alias 'Catherine de Hal', ancienne recluse de Wauthier-Braine. Elle fut la première prieure du couvent. Elle est citée dans une dizaine d'actes dont le premier est daté du 10 août 1405.
Alice Van Steenberghen. Elle est mentionnée comme supérieure dans un acte du 14 octobre 1437[4]. C'est sous son priorat qu'en 1443, Jean IV de Bourgogne, évêque de Cambrai, confirma le prieur de Groenendael en sa qualité de commissaire du prieuré de l'Ermite. À cette époque également la communauté désira adopter la clôture perpétuelle et d'avoir pour visiteurs, non plus des chanoines de Sept Fontaines, mais des prieurs de Groenendael et de Rouge-Cloître, les deux autres monastères de la trilogie augustinienne dans la forêt de Soignes.
Elisabeth Van den Velde. Elle est la troisième et dernière prieure de la communauté des chanoinesses de l'Ermite. Elle fut élevée à cette dignité en 1448. C'est également elle qui dirigea dès 1456 la nouvelle communauté de Jéricho à Bruxelles.";FAUX

Opus Dei (Work of God): The daily cycle of communal prayer (chanting the Psalms and other liturgical texts) would have been central to the nuns' lives.
Manual Labor: As per the Benedictine Rule. For nuns, this would likely include:
Textile work: Spinning, weaving (wool, linen), embroidery – essential for clothing and liturgical vestments. This was a very common activity for early medieval nunneries.
Gardening: Cultivating food and medicinal herbs within the monastic enclosure.
Household tasks: Cooking, cleaning, baking.
Possibly some manuscript copying or illumination if the nuns were literate and materials were available, though this was less common or extensive than in male monasteries of the time.
Hospitality: Providing shelter and aid to travelers and the poor, as far as their resources allowed.
Self-Sufficiency: The goal would be to support themselves from their lands and labor. The initial endowment of land by St. Adela or other patrons would have been crucial.
Spiritual Life: Personal prayer, reading of sacred texts (if available and if literate), and living a life of devotion under the authority of an Abbess.
Education (rudimentary): Possibly some basic education for the nuns themselves or for young girls (oblates) entrusted to the monastery.
In Summary:

The Benedictine foundation at Orp, under the patronage of St. Adela (almost certainly St. Adela of Pfalzel), was likely a nunnery established in 692 AD during the Merovingian period. It would have been a community of women dedicated to prayer, work, and Christian living, playing a role in the spiritual and social fabric of its local area in what is now Belgium. Its relatively short existence, ending around 799 AD due to ""local conflicts,"" reflects the often turbulent and unstable conditions of the early Middle Ages, where monastic communities could be vulnerable to political upheaval and violence.";FAUX

Au début du XVIe siècle, l'abbaye fut entraînée dans un mouvement de réforme spirituelle issu de l'abbaye de Marche-les-Dames, qui visait à rétablir un plus strict respect de la règle de saint Benoît. Aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles, les moniales furent contraintes de quitter deux fois leur abbaye, laquelle subit alors des pillages. Au XVIIIe siècle, la quasi-totalité des bâtiments furent reconstruits. Les abbesses développèrent l'enseignement en accueillant les enfants des environs. En 1796, la Révolution dispersa la communauté, l'abbaye étant vendue en 1799. Les bâtiments monastiques furent démantelés par les propriétaires successifs.

Depuis 2008, ce qui reste de l'abbaye de la Ramée est exclusivement destiné à l'accueil de séminaires d’entreprises. Elle est organisation associée à Europa Nostra Belgium [1], représentant en Belgique d'Europa Nostra, la Fédération européenne du patrimoine.

Histoire
Fondation et période de sérénité
L'implantation d'une communauté cistercienne de moniales à Jauchelette remonte aux années 1213-1215. Il semble acquis qu'une première implantation ait vu le jour quelques années voire quelques décennies plus tôt, à Kerkom (aujourd'hui en Flandre). Pour une raison inconnue, la communauté déménagea au début du XIIIe siècle sur des terres cédées par Gérard, seigneur de Jauche et ancien croisé. La fondation voit le jour grâce à la fille de ce dernier dénommée Héluide.

Dès le début, le couvent fut sous l'autorité religieuse de l'abbaye de Villers-la-Ville, aujourd'hui en Brabant wallon. Des frères convers de Villers participent par ailleurs à l'édification d'une partie des bâtiments de La Ramée. Son existence jusqu’au XVe siècle semble être celle d’un monastère sans histoire, malgré quelques incursions militaires sur ses terres.

L'abbaye est pieuse et docte, car il s'y trouve un scriptorium. Ida de Nivelles et Ida de Léau y vécurent.

Mouvement de réforme puis exils
Au tout début du XVIe siècle, l’abbaye de la Ramée est entraînée dans un mouvement de réforme spirituelle issu de l’abbaye de Marche-les-Dames, en province de Namur, qui visait à rétablir un plus strict respect de la règle de saint Benoît (notamment l’obligation de la clôture pour les religieuses).

Aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles, les moniales sont contraintes de s’exiler à deux reprises. L’abbaye ainsi abandonnée subit les affres du temps et des pillages. La position de l'abbaye, à la lisière du Brabant et de l'évêché de Liège, dans les larges plaines de la Hesbaye brabançonne, en fait une cible idéale pour les déserteurs en déroute, et un quartier général appréciable pour les troupes anglaises : en 1706, l’abbaye de la Ramée sert d’hôpital militaire lors de la bataille de Ramillies (remportée par le duc de Marlborough sur Louis XIV).

Second âge d'or
Le XVIIIe siècle correspond au second âge d’or de l’abbaye, et cet âge d'or sera bref. La quasi-totalité des bâtiments sont reconstruits, comme l'attestent de nombreux millésimes dans les pierres et les ancres. Notamment, le quartier abbatial est bâti par dame Séraphine Wouters en 1775. Ce quartier sera incorporé dans le couvent des sœurs du Sacré-Cœur. Les abbesses développent l’enseignement en accueillant les enfants des environs.

Révolution française
En 1796, lors de l'invasion des troupes républicaines et l' annexion française des États de Belgique, l'abbaye fut lourdement taxée puis confisquée comme bien national en 1796. L'école fut supprimée et les 28 cisterciennes expulsées. Quant au domaine, divisé en plusieurs lots, il fut vendu en 1799. La Révolution disperse la communauté [2].

Les bâtiments monastiques sont démantelés par les propriétaires successifs, avant que la Congrégation des Dames du Sacré-Cœur ne fasse l'acquisition de ce qu'il en restait (1903). Durant ce temps, et par après, la ferme et sa gigantesque grange (appelées en wallon cinse de l’Abîye) gardent leur fonction agricole.

En 1990, la S.A. Immobilière La Ramée acquiert la ferme pour la transformer en centre d’organisation d'événements culturels, familiaux ou d'entreprise. Des séminaires, des mariages et des événements publicitaires s'y déroulent tous les jours, tandis qu'un restaurant et qu'un hôtel complètent la gamme des services.

Depuis 2008, l'Abbaye de la Ramée est exclusivement destinée à l’accueil de séminaires d’entreprises.";FAUX

Elle fut créée en 1632 par le transfert de l’abbaye de Saint-Jean l’Évangéliste du bourg de Soyons (Ardèche) à la suite des guerres de Religion.

Histoire
Le monastère bénédictin de la commune ardéchoise de Soyons était l’un des plus anciens. Il aurait été créé par des religieuses venant de Viviers (Ardèche), où une petite communauté s’était formée autour du tombeau de saint Venance (ou Venant), évêque. Chassées par les invasions de Sarrasins, elles se seraient réfugiées à Soyons. Un important sanctuaire carolingien y a existé, dont on a retrouvé des vestiges. Un premier document faisant état du monastère daterait de 1179, mais son implantation était déjà très ancienne.

Lors des guerres de Religion, Soyons est aux mains des Protestants. Plusieurs combats s’y déroulent, jusqu’à la prise définitive de la cité par les troupes royales en 1629. Mais le monastère a énormément souffert, incendié par deux fois, ses biens ont été pillés, les religieuses elles-mêmes se sont dispersées. L’abbesse Antoinette de Sassenage décide alors de faire agréger son abbaye à celle de Chezal-Benoît. Puis elle obtient de réunir ses religieuses dans un nouveau monastère à Valence. Elle achète des terres en ville basse, sur les bords du Rhône. Les travaux sont achevés en 1632.";FAUX

Au XIVe siècle, au lendemain de la guerre et de la peste de 1348, une insécurité croissante apparait et le domaine se fragilise comme de nombreux monastères cisterciens. Les moniales recherchent une protection qu’elles trouveront en la personne d’Humbert II, « le Dauphin » et sa mère Béatrix de Hongrie.

Puis, l’abbaye fut déplacée à Valence au XVIIe siècle. Par la suite, le domaine de Vernaison sert à différents usages : lieu de quarantaine pendant la peste de Marseille de 1720, lieu de pèlerinage, résidence secondaire de l’abbesse Anne de Monteynard jusqu’en 1790. ";FAUX

Through donations, the abbey became one of the richest in Brabant. However, the monastery was destroyed by military operations in 1489 and 1507 and was not rebuilt until the end of the 16th century. The costs for this were paid from the sale of possessions, which impoverished the abbey and caused conflicts with the board of Oplinter regarding the payment of taxes. This was especially the case at the end of the 18th century.

The nuns also ran a boarding school. Many of the sisters came from Wallonia and they did not speak the Dutch language. This also led to a request, after the death of the Walloon prioress Ferdinanda de Sprimont, to push back a Flemish prioress, unless the Walloon influence on the abdye welcke is now ruled over those fifteen years of Luyckernessen. Thus, in 1686, the Tienen sister Cecilia Immens was appointed prioress.

Today
When the French invaded, the abbey was dissolved. This happened on December 6, 1796, after which the buildings were sold publicly on June 30, 1798. Part of the choir stalls can still be found in the churches of Hakendover and Orsmaal. Some statues and a triumphal cross ended up in the Sint-Genoveva church in Oplinter.

Today, the Hoeve van Maagdendal remains of the monastery with an impressive gatehouse and large parts of the original monastery wall. The whole gives a neglected impression. The sculpture group in the niche above the gate has been badly damaged in recent decades. Whereas in the illustrations accompanying the article by Leo Tulkens (1959)[1] the images of God the Father with a globe and the kneeling Saint Bernard are still intact, they are missing today. The ornate robe of the Blessed Virgin and natural ornaments were also removed and replaced by brickwork.

Below the sculpture group is a chronogram with the year 1656: DuCe Deo - et bernarDo - Lacta VIa (Life is beautiful under the guidance of God and Saint Bernard).";FAUX

Deze abdij werd gesticht in de 12e eeuw als Sint-Katelijneklooster (Conventus Sancte Catherine of het Sint-Catharinaklooster van Sint-Truiden). Het bevond zich juist buiten de stadsomwalling van Sint-Truiden, op de plaats van het huidige station. In 1193 werd de Sint-Catharinakerk van het klooster ingewijd. Deze werd in de 18e eeuw afgebroken.

In 1231 verhuisden de zusters naar Metsteren, waar ze een uitgebreid complex bouwden, dat in 1543 tot abdij werd verheven. Het goed bevond zich op een omgracht perceel, met in het westen de Melsterbeek. In de 18e eeuw was het klooster een L-vormig gebouwencomplex, waarin zich ook een gasthuis en een kerk bevond. Daarnaast bezat de abdij drie hoeven, waarvan er nog één bewaard is gebleven. Daarnaast bezat ze een watermolen op de Melsterbeek: de Metsterenmolen.

Foundation (c. 650 AD):
* Historical Context: This is the Merovingian period. Frankish noblewomen played a significant role in founding monasteries, often as places for their own spiritual retreat, for other women in their families, and as centers of Christian influence.
* Foundress - Saint Landrada: Tradition strongly attributes the foundation of Munsterbilzen Abbey (often dated around 650-670 AD) to Saint Landrada, a Frankish noblewoman. She is considered its first abbess.
* Benedictine Rule: For such an early date, ""Benedictine"" means it would have been among the earliest adopters of the Rule of St. Benedict in the region, or at least heavily influenced by it. Often, these early foundations followed a ""mixed rule,"" incorporating elements of the older, stricter Columbanian Rule (brought by Irish missionaries) with the more moderate and organizing Benedictine Rule, which was gaining prominence and would eventually become standard.
* ""Belisia"": This is an older name for Bilzen, or the specific locality. ""Munsterbilzen"" means ""Monastery at Bilzen.""

2. Patron Saint - ""St. Amor"":
* This is where there's a slight complexity for the founding period. While relics of Saint Amor (a deacon or hermit from Aquitaine, active in the Maastricht region, d. 8th or 9th century) were later translated to Munsterbilzen (likely in the 10th century after its refoundation following Viking destructions), and the abbey church eventually became known as St. Amor's, he is not typically associated with its initial 7th-century foundation by St. Landrada.
* The primary early dedication of a nunnery founded by a female saint like Landrada would often have been to the Virgin Mary, or Landrada herself would have been the key figure of veneration for the community.
* So, for the period 650-800 AD, the direct patronage of ""St. Amor"" is anachronistic. The data might be conflating the original foundation with a later period after St. Amor's relics arrived.

3. Life in the Benedictine Nunnery (c. 650 - 800 AD):
* Community of Nuns: Led by an Abbess (St. Landrada being the first).
* Rule of Life: Focused on the Opus Dei (Divine Office – daily cycle of communal prayer), Lectio Divina (sacred reading and study), and Labora (manual work).
* Manual Work: For nuns, this would predominantly involve:
* Textile production: Spinning, weaving (wool, linen), embroidery. This was crucial for clothing, liturgical vestments, and potentially for trade or gifts.
* Gardening: Cultivating food (vegetables, herbs) within the monastic enclosure.
* Household tasks: Cooking, cleaning, managing the community's domestic needs.
* Scriptorium (possibly): Some early nunneries did engage in copying manuscripts if they had literate members and resources.
* Land Holdings: The abbey would have been endowed with lands to support itself.
* Spiritual Center: It would have been a significant center of Christian prayer and influence in the region, contributing to the ongoing Christianization of the Frankish lands.

Elle a été fondée avant 1200[N 2] et est située en plein cœur de la forêt de Mercoire, au pied du Moure de la Gardille, proche de la source de l'Allier.

Histoire
Fondation
Au XIIe siècle, Guillaume de Randon, baron de Randon en Gévaudan, offre une partie de la forêt de Mercoire aux moniales de l'abbaye soit un sixième des 10 000 hectares[1]. Les premiers textes nous apprennent que l'abbaye était liée à l'abbaye d'hommes de Mazan, en Vivarais. Cependant, à ce moment-là, l'abbaye n'est rattachée à aucune maison mère.

Prospérité
Rapidement, l'abbaye commence une croissance. Ainsi, se développent la culture et surtout l'élevage sur leur domaine. L'abbaye fait aussi l'acquisition d'autres domaines, dont l'un vers Joyeuse en Vivarais (plus exactement Rosières) depuis 1236 des Chateauneuf-de-Randon. Elle bénéficie également de nouveau dons de la maison de Randon, comme le domaine de Pont-de-la-Veissière et sa maladrerie, situé entre Langogne et Luc[1].

Le nombre de moniales atteint rapidement 50 religieuses consacrées, auquel il faut ajouter 15 demoiselles qui sont soit des novices, soit des filles de la noblesse locale, élevées à Mercoire. La règle appliquée au sein de l'abbaye est celle de l'idéal monastique de Citeaux.


Copie d'un acte notarié concernant l'abbaye de Mercoire.
Déclin
Au XVe siècle elles ne sont déjà plus qu'une quinzaine. Cependant, jusqu'en 1563, et le concile de Trente, des hommes sont également présent dans l'abbaye, dont un chapelain.

Arrivent ensuite les guerres de Religion consécutives au massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy. Le capitaine huguenot Matthieu Merle ravage une grande partie du pays. Vers 1578, il arrive à Mercoire et détruit le couvent. L'abbesse, Hélix de Rochemure, s'est retirée sur Mende avec les objets les plus précieux. Au début du XVIIe siècle, la nouvelle abbesse consent à vendre les possessions en Vivarais pour reconstruire l'abbaye, puisque l'église comme les logements ont été détruits[1].

Peu de temps après, il est évoqué la possibilité de transférer l'abbaye sur Mende ou Langogne, mais l'idée est abandonnée en 1659. Elles sont alors 16 moniales présentes en 1688 [2].

Depuis le XVIIIe siècle

Autre vue de l'abbaye.
En 1716, l'abbaye n'est pas en bon état. Si le réfectoire et les cellules sont toujours entretenus, l'église ne l'est plus. Les moniales se contentent de la chapelle attenante, dont les dimensions sont plus cohérentes avec leur nombre. Puis, en 1773, l'abbaye brûle presque entièrement. Seules l'église et la chapelle sont épargnées par l'incendie. L'église est alors cloisonnée pour pouvoir loger les moniales[1]. Grâce à l'apport notable de Louis XV de France, les bâtiments sont reconstruits assez rapidement.

Au moment de la Révolution française, elles sont sept moniales, dont deux sont absentes[3]. L'inventaire de l'abbaye se déroule le 11 août 1790, à l'issue duquel il est demandé aux moniales si elles désirent conserver leur statut ou retourner à la vie civile. Les cinq présentes à ce moment-là désirent rester religieuses[3]. L'une des absentes déclare la même chose un peu plus tard, alors que la seconde s'est éloignée de l'abbaye pour régler des problèmes de santé.

Elles restent donc toutes à Mercoire, mais ne reçoivent pas la pension qu'elles avaient reçue jusque-là. Elles sont donc dans un état de pauvreté proche de la misère. Aussi l'administration départementale décide le 14 juillet 1791, de fournir une pension pour qu'elles subviennent à leurs besoins. Le 15 juillet 1792, une perquisition a lieu, un voisin ayant dénoncé l'abbaye comme cachant des « suspects dangereux ». Rien n'est trouvé et il n'y a pas de suite. En revanche, le 29 décembre 1792, plus aucune moniale n'est présente dans l'abbaye[3]. En effet, la loi du 18 août 1792 dissout l'ensemble des congrégations religieuses, y compris enseignantes. L'abbaye est alors vendue comme bien national en 1793. Entre-temps, Alexandre-Paul de Randon, le « marquis Rouge » de la Révolution française, député du Gévaudan, avait tenté de sauver l'édifice en voulant le faire classer comme hospice ou maison de charité[1]. Le projet n'a pas eu de suite.

Elle est rachetée par un propriétaire en 1875, qui la transforme en ferme.

History

Stained glass windows,Collection Cinquantenaire, Brussels.

Arms of abbot Guillelmus Herent (1643), Brussels.
The abbey was founded in 1129 by Duke Godfrey, surnamed ""Barbatus"" (""the Bearded""), who possessed an immense park near Leuven and had invited the Premonstratensians to take possession of a small church he had built there.

Walter, abbot of St Martin's, Laon, brought a colony of his canons and acted as their superior for nearly three years, until the canons, now in sufficient number, elected Simon, another canon of Laon, as their abbot. The canons performed the general work of the ministry in the district of Leuven, in opposition to the heretic Tanchelm.

In 1137 the abbot was able to found Ninove Abbey. Godfrey made the Abbot of the Park and his successors his archchaplains. Simon died on 30 March 1142 and was succeeded by Philip, whose correspondence with Saint Hildegard of Bingen was preserved in the Park Abbey archives. Philip and his successors enlarged the buildings and prepared the land for agriculture. At the time there a canon living in the abbey, Blessed Rabado, whose devotion to the Passion was attested by miracles.

Abbot Gerard van Goetsenhoven (1414–34) had much to do with the establishment of the Catholic University of Leuven, and was also delegated by John IV, Duke of Brabant to transact state affairs with the King of England and the Duke of Burgundy. Abbot van Tulden (1462–94) was successful in his action against commendatory abbots being imposed on religious houses in Belgium. Abbot van den Berghe (1543–58) managed the contributions levied in support of the Belgian theologians present at the resumed Council of Trent.


The abbey seen from across one of the fishponds
The abbey frequently suffered during the wars waged by William of Orange and the Calvinists. Abbots included Loots (1577–1583), van Vlierden (1583–1601), Jan Druys (1601–1634), Maes (1635–1647), De Pape (1648–1682), and van Tuycum (1682–1702). They all favoured higher education at the University of Leuven, and academic study flourished in the abbey.

Under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the abbey was confiscated, because Abbot Wauters (died 23 November 1792) refused to send his religious to the general seminary erected by the emperor at Leuven. In the successful revolution against the emperor, the religious returned to their abbey. Wauters was succeeded by Melchior Nysmans (1793–1810).


Monk of Park Abbey
Under the French Republic the abbey was confiscated again on 1 February 1797. At the request of the people the church was declared to be a parish church and was thus saved. The abbey was bought by a friendly layman who wished to preserve it for the religious, in better times. One of the canons, in the capacity of parish priest, remained in or near the abbey.

When Belgium was made a kingdom and religious freedom was restored, the surviving religious resumed community life and elected Peter Ottoy, then rural dean of Diest, as their superior.

In 1897 the abbey undertook the foundation of a priory in Brazil.

The canons of Park Abbey published the following reviews:

(1) ""Analectes de l'Ordre de Prémontré"" (four times a year);
(2) ""Revue de l'Ordre de Prémontré et de ses missions"" (six times a year); ""'T Park's maandschrift"" (monthly).";FAUX

Postel Abbey (Abdij van Postel) is a Premonstratensian (Norbertine) house founded in 1134 in what is now the Belgian province of Antwerp.  During the Middle Ages it combined the liturgical and pastoral life of canons regular with substantial economic and cultural activity.  

1. Foundation and Order  
 • 1134 – Established by Premonstratensian canons from Floreffe Abbey under the Rule of St. Augustine.  
 • Premonstratensians (“White Canons”) were clergy living in community, committed to both contemplative prayer and active ministry.  

2. Monastic Layout and Buildings  
 • Romanesque core with later Gothic expansion: abbey church, cloister, chapter house, dormitory and refectory.  
 • Infirmary, guesthouses and workshops clustered around a series of courtyards.  

3. Liturgical and Pastoral Work  
 • Daily Divine Office in choir (Matins, Lauds, Prime etc.) and solemn Masses on feast days.  
 • Pastoral care of local parishes and chapels: preaching, baptisms, marriages, burials.  
 • Hospitality: hospitality to pilgrims, travelers and the poor was a key Premonstratensian commitment.  

4. Economic Activities  
 • Agriculture: cereal growing on abbey lands; sheep and cattle pasturage.  
 • Fish ponds: carp and tench farming was widespread in Low Countries monasteries.  
 • Milling and baking: watermills on the Molse Nete river processed grain, and an abbey bakery supplied bread.  
 • Brewing and cheese-making: monks brewed beer for their own use and local sale, and developed a semi–soft “Postel” cheese tradition.  
 • Forest and woodland management: sustainable timber, charcoal production, and beekeeping (honey for monks’ use and as an income source).  

5. Scholarship and Scriptoria  
 • Manuscript copying and illumination: theological, liturgical and devotional texts for the abbey and for patron churches.  
 • A small school for novices and sometimes lay children, teaching Latin, basic arithmetic, chanting and theology.  

6. Social and Charitable Outreach  
 • Relief to the poor: distribution of alms, food and clothing in times of famine or pestilence.  
 • Medical care: abbey infirmary cared for sick canons and sometimes lay patients.  
 • Mediating disputes among local landowners and townsfolk, thanks to the abbey’s moral authority.  

7. Relations with Secular Powers  
 • As a landed institution, Postel Abbey held manorial rights over villages, collecting tithes and rents.  
 • The abbey enjoyed papal protection but also navigated feudal obligations to local counts or dukes.  
 • Gifts and endowments from nobility often funded building campaigns or the establishment of daughter priories.  

By the end of the Middle Ages, Postel Abbey was both a spiritual center and a significant local economic engine. Its Premonstratensian canons embodied the order’s dual vocation: the solemn prayer life of a monastery combined with active service to the Church and society. Today some of those medieval buildings survive, and the abbey continues in religious life—still known, among other things, for its brewery and cheese.";FAUX

Depuis 2005, les bâtiments ont le statut de monument protégé au sein de l'agence flamande pour le patrimoine immobilier.

Fondation
La fondation est antérieure à 1105, traditionnellement datée de 1095. Celle-ci a été confirmée par Odon de Tournai en 1110[1].

Histoire constitutionnelle du duché de Brabant
L'abbaye était un lieu important de l'histoire constitutionnelle du duché de Brabant. En effet, c'est là que la charte de Cortenbergh, l'équivalent de la Magna Carta dans le duché de Brabant[2], avait été signée en 1312 et c'est également-là que le conseil de Cortenbergh qui avait été institué pour superviser la mise en œuvre de cette charte se réunissait.


Abbaye de Cortenbergh en 1659
Différend sur les dîmes
En 1129, Burchard, évêque de Cambrai, attribue à l'abbaye les paroisses de Leest et de Hombeek, qui font maintenant partie de la commune de Malines, avec toutes les dîmes et tous autres avantages. En 1707, le curé de Leest commença à réclamer les dîmes sur les terres nouvellement aménagées dans la paroisse, arguant que celles-ci n'auraient pu être incluses dans le don initial. L’affaire qui en a résulté a été portée devant le plus grand tribunal des Pays-Bas autrichiens, le Grand Conseil de Malines, le monastère étant représenté par le juriste renommé Zeger Bernhard van Espen[3].

Fermée à la Révolution française, l'abbaye est vendue en deux lots vers 1799. Depuis 2005, l'ancienne abbaye est inscrite à l'inventaire des monuments protégés en Région flamande[4].";FAUX

Geschiedenis
De abdij werd gesticht omstreeks 1237 op de Wolfsput en lag op een stuk land gekapt uit het Petanenbos aan de grens met Geetbets en Kortenaken. In 1242 werd ze verplaatst naar de huidige locatie, aan de oever van de Velpe, tussen Velpen en Rotem (Halen). Een bijbehorende watermolen, de Rotemse Molen, werd kort na 1422 gebouwd.

In 1304 werd het patronaatsrecht van de kapel toegekend aan de Abdij van Godsdal in Aubel, en later kwam het aan de Abdij van Villers. Vanaf 1735 kwam dit recht aan de Abdij van Saint-Sauveur.

De kerk werd gebouwd van 1323-1324, in 1355 werd begonnen met de bouw van de kloostergebouwen en in 1518 werden nieuwe kloostergebouwen opgericht. In 1669 kwam het huidige poortgebouw tot stand en begin 18e eeuw, onder abdis Constance de Millet, waren er vele bouwactiviteiten. In 1711 werd de kerk verbouwd, in 1714 werd een abdissenkwartier tot stand gebracht, in 1722 een neerhof en in 1728 een gastenverblijf. In 1777 en 1779 werden nieuwe dienstgebouwen opgericht. Omstreeks 1796 (de Franse tijd) werd de abdij opgeheven. Kerk en klooster werden gesloopt.

De abdij is nimmer erg groot geweest, omdat er zich meerdere cisterciënzerabdijen in de omgeving bevonden.

Heden
Het poortgebouw uit 1669 is nog aanwezig. Het is een bakstenen gebouw met zandstenen versieringen. In 1777 werd het aanzien van het poortgebouw gewijzigd. De grote korfboogpoort en het naastgelegen voetgangerspoortje zijn uit dit jaar.

Tegenwoordig maakt dit poortgebouw onderdeel uit van een hoevecomplex: de Rotemhoeve, vroeger de boerderij van het klooster. Het is een gesloten hoeve met gebouwen uit onder meer de tweede helft van de 18e eeuw. Naast de hoeve bevindt zich een tuin en een boomgaard. Het indrukwekkende complex is ook landschappelijk van belang.

Hombeek ‒ strictly speaking a rural parish just north-west of Mechelen (province of Antwerp, formerly duchy of Brabant) ‒ possessed a small Premonstratensian convent of canonesses regular from the 13th century until its suppression at the end of the 18th century.  Because it never reached the political or intellectual weight of Park, Tongerlo or Floreffe, it is only sporadically mentioned in narrative sources; nevertheless a fair amount can be reconstructed from charters preserved in the Mechelen city archives (Cartularium “Hombeka”) and from the early modern order-chronicles of Miraeus and Le Paige.

1.  Foundation and canonical status  
• Name in the medieval documents: domus / monasterium Sanctae Mariae de Humbeka, later simply Norbertinessen van Hombeek.  
• Date: c. 1225–1230.  A foundation charter no longer extant but copied in a 17th-c. résumé attributes the initiative to Wouter (Walter) I Berthout, lord of Mechelen, who donated a tract of alluvial land on the Zenne together with the tithe of the parish church.  
• Mother-house: Park Abbey (near Leuven).  The first superior, “magistra Hildegondis”, and four professed sisters were transferred from Park, and Hombeek remained a canonical daughter of Park until the French Revolution.  
• Order: Premonstratensian canonesses regular (white habit, Rule of St Augustine with the constitutions of St Norbert).  They were not cloistered as strictly as Cistercian nuns but lived a common life based on the liturgical hours and service to the surrounding population.

2.  Size of the community  
• High Middle Ages: probably never more than 18–20 professed canonesses plus a handful of novices and conversae.  The parochial visitation of 1288 notes 17 “sorores clausae” and 6 lay sisters.  
• Late Middle Ages: plague and warfare reduced the house to c. 12–14 choir sisters (figures from the diocesan “status animarum” of 1447 and 1489).  
• On the eve of the suppression (1796) there were 9 canonesses and 4 lay sisters.

3.  Material resources  
• Endowments: c. 200 bonniers (≈ 170 ha) of arable and meadow in Hombeek, Zemst and Leest; two granges run by hired laymen; fishing rights along the Zenne and a water-mill (built 1295).  
• Rents & tithes: small but steady income from parts of the great tithe of Hombeek parish and from obits founded by Mechelen patrician families in the 14th–15th centuries.  
• Craft and domestic production: the sisters wove linen both for their own use and for sale on the Mechelen market; a brewhouse is mentioned in 1381. As in most women’s houses of the order, manuscript copying is attested only indirectly (purchase of parchment and ink, 1337, 1352) and must have been limited.

Religious and social activity
• Liturgy: full canonical Office in choir; Mass for villagers on Sundays and feast-days (the parish rectory was united to the convent from 1264, so one canon from Park served as chaplain-pastor).
• Works of mercy: a modest infirmary/hospice wing on the south side of the enclosure offered three beds “pro pauperibus peregrinis” (visitation of 1420). Annual dole of bread on the feast of St Mary Magdalen (22 July).
• Education: from the later 15th century the sisters accepted a small number of paying boarders (“zennekens”) – girls from Mechelen patrician families who received elementary instruction and needle-work, a common survival strategy for Brabantine nunneries after the Black Death.

Crises and rebuilding
• Flooding: the low, marshy situation by the Zenne caused repeated losses. A disastrous inundation in 1404 destroyed the mill and much of the grange at Weerde; a new, slightly higher site inside a protective dike-bank was occupied 1410-1415 (the only major construction phase of the Middle Ages still visible in the masonry of today’s farm buildings).
• War: in 1572, during the early Dutch Revolt, Hombeek was plundered by Calvinist free-booters from nearby Willebroek; the canonesses took temporary refuge inside the city walls of Mechelen. Repairs followed in the 1590s with the help of Archduke-Albertine subsidies.
• Fire: the wooden cloister walk burnt in 1643 but was rebuilt in brick by 1648. Most of the visible conventual range dates from this 17th-century reconstruction, not from the Middle Ages.

Suppression and afterlife
• The Austrian religious reforms of 1783 spared Hombeek, but the French annexation did not: the house was secularised by decree of 1 September 1796, the sisters expelled, and the lands sold as “bien national”.
• A few canonesses were allowed to live together in a rented house at Mechelen until the last survivor died in 1812.
• The convent church was demolished; part of the 17th-c. east range became a farmhouse still called “het Norbertinessenhof”. Nothing of the medieval choir or cloister arcades survives above ground, though pottery and grave slabs have been found during small-scale excavations (1988, 2003).

What remains and how to visit
• Location: Dijle-Zenne polder country, 2 km north of Hombeek village centre (modern address: Norbertinessenweg). Private property; the farm can be viewed from the public road.
• Visible fabric: the refectory wing (lower courses 14th c., upper part 1640s), a rib-vaulted cellar (probably c. 1300) and the 1295 mill foundations along the Zenne tow-path.
• Archives: charter copies in Stadsarchief Mechelen, bundles";FAUX

Ah, Marcigny Abbey is a very significant and interesting case within the Cluniac world!

Located in Marcigny, in the Saône-et-Loire department of Burgundy, France (the heartland of the Cluniac Order itself, not far from Cluny Abbey), it was unique because it was the first and principal priory for Cluniac nuns.

Here's what life and activities would have been like at Marcigny Abbey (often referred to as a Prioressy, headed by a Prioress, though ""Abbey"" is also used in some contexts due to its importance) during medieval times:

Foundation and Unique Status:

Founded around 1055 by St. Hugh of Cluny (Hugh the Great), one of the most influential abbots of Cluny.
Dedicated to the Holy Trinity (Sainte-Trinité).
Purpose: St. Hugh founded Marcigny specifically to provide a place for women (often relatives of the Cluniac monks or noble benefactors) who wished to live a monastic life according to Cluniac ideals. It was essentially the female counterpart to the great Abbey of Cluny.
Motherhouse for Cluniac Nuns: Marcigny became the ""motherhouse"" for other Cluniac nunneries that were subsequently founded. It held a preeminent position among them.
Life of the Cluniac Nuns:

Rule of St. Benedict with Cluniac Customs: The nuns followed the Rule of St. Benedict, adapted for women and incorporating the specific liturgical and disciplinary customs of the Cluniac Order.
Primacy of Liturgy (Opus Dei): This was paramount. The nuns would have devoted a significant portion of their day and night to the solemn and elaborate chanting of the Divine Office in their priory church. Daily Mass was also central. Their liturgy would have mirrored the grandeur of Cluny, albeit on a scale appropriate for a nunnery.
Strict Enclosure: As nuns, they lived a strictly enclosed life within the priory walls, with limited contact with the outside world. This was considered essential for a life dedicated to prayer and contemplation.
Community Life: Headed by a Prioress (who was a very significant figure, often from a high noble family). The nuns lived in common, sharing meals (often in silence with spiritual readings), work, and prayer.
Manual Labor (adapted): While the Cluniac emphasis was heavily on liturgy, manual labor was still part of the Benedictine rule. For the nuns at Marcigny, this would include:
Fine Needlework and Embroidery (Opus Cluniacense): Cluniac houses were known for their splendid liturgical vestments and altar furnishings. The nuns at Marcigny would have been highly skilled in these arts, producing exquisite textiles.
Spinning and Weaving: Producing cloth for their habits and other needs.
Manuscript Work: Copying and illuminating manuscripts, especially choir books and devotional texts. Nunneries often had active scriptoria.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for herbs (medicinal and culinary), vegetables, and flowers.
General upkeep of their living quarters.
Language: Liturgical Latin for prayers and Mass; Old French (specifically the Burgundian dialect) for everyday communication.
Social Composition and Importance:

Aristocratic Nuns: Marcigny attracted women from the highest echelons of French and European nobility. Daughters, sisters, and widows of kings, dukes, and counts entered Marcigny. This gave the priory immense prestige, wealth, and political connections.
Influence: Due to its noble connections and its status as the leading Cluniac nunnery, Marcigny wielded considerable influence.
Wealth and Endowments: The priory was richly endowed with lands, properties, and revenues by its noble patrons.";FAUX

They sent her to another community, probablyÂ Facons, where she died in 1455. Alijt Bake wrote an autobiography, in which she stated that she modeled herself after Colette of Corbie. Alijt had visions, which perhaps were responsible for her election as prioress of this community.

C'est ainsi qu'est fondé, vers 1343, dans la forêt de Soignes, en Brabant, à 14 km au sud-est de Bruxelles, un monastère de chanoines augustins.

La fondation de Groenendael prospérait vers 1400, ayant essaimé à plusieurs reprises dans la forêt de Soignes, dès la seconde moitié du XIVe siècle. Ces fondations formaient ensemble, en 1402, la congrégation de Groenendael, rassemblant ainsi les prieurés et monastères brabançons. Charles Quint, accompagné de nombreuses têtes couronnées, passait fréquemment par Groenendael pour s'adonner à la chasse. Mais réduit au rang de prieuré au XVe siècle, puis supprimé car couvent inutile en 1784, par décret de l'empereur Joseph II, il fut démoli peu après.

Administrativement, Groenendael se trouve aujourd'hui dans la commune de Hoeilaart, dans le Brabant flamand (Région flamande de Belgique).

The monastery was established in or before 1227 by the nobleman Gillis Berthout, according to later tradition for his daughters Elizabeth and Oda. An early member of the community who gave it a wider reputation for sanctity was Blessed Ida of Louvain.[1]

The monastery was ordered closed in 1795, during the French occupation of Belgium, and the nuns were forced off the premises in January 1797. The main building became a country house in the 19th century.[2]

In 1828 the archivist of the National Archives of Belgium was notified that a pile of old parchment was available from a second-hand clothes dealer in Brussels.

There was indeed a well-known convent dedicated to Saint Agnes in Maaseik (Belgium, province of Limburg).
However, this was typically a house of Augustinian nuns (or Canonesses Regular of St. Augustine). These convents were relatively common in the Low Countries.
It was founded in the late medieval period (e.g., early 15th century, around 1429, though sources might vary slightly).
These Augustinian convents focused on a life of prayer, community, and often education or care for the sick/poor, depending on their specific statutes.
Like most religious houses, it would have been suppressed during the period of the French Revolution or the subsequent secularizations (late 18th/early 19th century).";FAUX

Historique
Pépin le Bref, roi de France, y met en place en 759 des chanoines séculiers en remplacement des religieuses bénédictines qui étaient présentes depuis 680[1].

Sur demande de Samson de Mauvoisin († 1161), 50e archevêque de Reims ; l'abbaye Saint-Jean-des-Vignes de Soisson a envoyé Gilbert et quatre confrères à Valenciennes, il deviendra Abbé et en 1110 des Chanoines réguliers prés possession de l'abbaye[2].

En août 1794, après la libération de la ville, l'abbaye est provisoirement transformée en prison pour les émigrés, et tous ceux qui s'étaient réfugiés dans la ville pendant le siège, tous les fonctionnaires et magistrats qui avaient accepté des emplois pendant l'occupation[3].
En octobre 1794 l'abbaye sert de prison à des ursulines qui étaient parties pour Mons, les juges populaires demandèrent si Citoyenne, tu as immigré, leur départ fut considéré comme crime et une condamnation à mort prononcée et exécutée dans la journée sur l'échafaud situé en place d'Armes[4].

L'abbaye Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth est un monastère de moniales cisterciennes-trappistines situé à Brecht en Belgique.

Fondée à Lierre en bord de Nèthe en 1230, et devenue cistercienne en 1236, avec Béatrice de Nazareth comme première prieure, l'abbaye a prospéré durant cinq siècles, connaissant des périodes de grande ferveur et rayonnement et d'autres de relâchement et déclin. L'abbaye fut supprimée par le pouvoir révolutionnaire français en 1797.

En 1950, une nouvelle communauté cistercienne venue de l'abbaye Notre-Dame de Soleilmont s'est établie à Brecht, en Campine (Belgique), reprenant le nom et relevant la tradition monastique de l'ancienne abbaye. En 1962, à son tour, l'abbaye Notre-Dame de Nazareth a fondé d'une part l'abbaye de Redwoods, en Californie (États-Unis), et d'autre part, en 1970, le prieuré Notre-Dame de Klaarland, près de Hasselt, en Belgique.

L'abbaye Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth compte, en 2017, une petite trentaine de moniales. La communauté vit de son travail, les ateliers monastiques fabriquant des vêtements liturgiques et divers autres produits. Elle gère aussi une petite hôtellerie.";FAUX

Situation
L'abbaye est située sur la commune de Villeneuve-la-Lionne, dans le département de la Marne, mais à quelques centaines de mètres seulement de la commune de Meilleray, située en Seine-et-Marne. Les bâtiments sont situés dans la vallée, entre le Grand Morin et l'ancienne ligne de Paris à Sézanne[3].

Histoire
Fondation d'une abbaye féminime
Fondée en 1242, l'abbaye accueille une communauté féminine dépendant directement de Morimond. Toutefois, elle est transformée en 1510 en prieuré, faute d'une communauté suffisante pour la faire vivre.

Un monastère masculin
En 1567, elle est mise à sac par les huguenots. À cette occasion, la communauté féminine est remplacée par une communauté masculine de moines cisterciens[4] et dépend par la suite de Clairvaux[5]. En 1768, il n'y reste qu'un seul moine. L'abbaye est dissoute à la Révolution française.";FAUX

Arrival: The Franciscans likely arrived in Bruges in the first half of the 13th century, possibly around the 1240s or 1250s. This was a period of rapid growth for the Franciscan order across Europe, and Bruges was a booming, wealthy international trading hub, making it a prime location for mendicant orders who focused on urban ministry.
Location: True to their mendicant ideals of ministering to the urban populace, especially the poor, they typically established their monasteries (or ""friaries,"" more accurately) within or just near the city walls, often in less affluent areas initially, though their establishments could grow quite substantial over time due to donations. In Bruges, their monastery was located in the Braambergstraat area.
Purpose: Unlike contemplative monastic orders (like Benedictines or Cistercians) who often sought rural seclusion, Franciscans were dedicated to preaching, hearing confessions, caring for the poor and sick, and living a life of apostolic poverty in urban centers.
Activities of the Franciscan Friary in Medieval Bruges:

Preaching and Pastoral Care:

Sermons: This was a cornerstone of their mission. Friars would preach in their own church and potentially in public squares, using the vernacular language (Middle Dutch/Flemish) to reach the common people. Their sermons would focus on repentance, Gospel values, and practical morality.
Confession: Franciscans were popular confessors, offering spiritual guidance and absolution to the laity.
Spiritual Direction: They would provide spiritual counsel to individuals and families, including members of the wealthy merchant class and guilds.
Charitable Work:

Care for the Poor and Sick: In line with St. Francis's emphasis, they would have engaged in direct aid to the needy, distributing alms, and possibly tending to the sick, though specialized hospitals run by other orders or lay confraternities were also common.
Hospitality: While not their primary function, friaries often offered some level of hospitality to travelers or those in need.
Religious Services and Liturgy:

Daily Office and Mass: Like all religious communities, they would have maintained a regular cycle of prayer, including the Divine Office and daily Mass, which would have been open to the public.
Funerals and Burials: Friary churches were popular burial places for laypeople, including wealthy patrons. Being buried ""ad sanctos"" (near the saints/holy men) was considered spiritually beneficial. This also brought significant income and patronage to the friary.
Study and Intellectual Life:

While St. Francis initially emphasized simplicity over learning, the order quickly recognized the need for educated friars to preach effectively and combat heresy.
Many Franciscan friaries developed studia (houses of study) for the theological training of their members. Given Bruges' importance, its Franciscan friary likely had a studium that might have attracted friars from the wider region.
Some friars would have been involved in theological writing or copying manuscripts, though perhaps not on the scale of older Benedictine scriptoria.
Interaction with the Urban Community:

Support from Guilds and Patrons: The friary would have relied on donations from the citizens of Bruges – wealthy merchants, guilds, and ordinary people. This support could take the form of money, food, building materials, or endowments for chantries (masses said for the soul of a donor).
Influence: Through preaching and confession, they exerted considerable moral and spiritual influence on the city's populace.
Conflict Resolution: Respected religious figures were sometimes called upon to mediate disputes within the community.
Living by Mendicancy:

In theory, Franciscans lived by begging for their daily needs. While this ideal was sometimes compromised as friaries acquired property and wealth, the principle of relying on the charity of the faithful remained important.";FAUX

Like in many other major European towns, the Franciscans (Cordeliers) established themselves in Clermont in the first half of the 13th century. This period saw a rapid expansion of mendicant orders across Europe. They likely arrived sometime between the 1220s and 1250s.
Location:

The Couvent des Cordeliers in Clermont-Ferrand was typically situated within or very near the city walls, often in areas that allowed them easy access to the urban population they served. Historical records and street names often give clues. In Clermont-Ferrand, there is still a Rue des Cordeliers, which strongly indicates the former location of their convent, likely near the central Place de Jaude.
Activities:

Preaching and Pastoral Care: Their primary mission was preaching the Gospel in the vernacular, hearing confessions, and providing spiritual guidance to the townspeople. Their churches were designed to hold large congregations for sermons.
Charity: They engaged in charitable works, assisting the poor and the sick, in line with Franciscan ideals.
Education and Study: Many Franciscan convents became centers of learning, housing libraries and studia for the education of their friars. Given Clermont's importance, its Franciscan house would likely have had some intellectual standing.
Burials: Their church and cemetery were popular burial places for local citizens, including nobles and wealthy bourgeois, who sought the spiritual benefits of being interred near the friars. This also provided a significant source of income and patronage for the convent.
Influence: The Cordeliers often wielded considerable influence in urban affairs due to their popularity and moral authority.
The Convent Buildings:

A typical Cordelier convent would have included a church (often quite large, but perhaps initially simpler in design than older monastic churches), a cloister, a refectory (dining hall), a dormitory, a chapter house, and possibly a library and infirmary.
Over time, with patronage, these convents could become quite substantial and architecturally impressive.
The French Revolution and Suppression:

The Couvent des Cordeliers in Clermont, like almost all religious houses in France, was suppressed during the French Revolution (1789-1799).
Its property was confiscated by the state, declared ""bien national"" (national property), and sold off. The friars were dispersed.
The buildings were often repurposed for secular uses (e.g., barracks, administrative offices, factories) or demolished for building materials or urban redevelopment.
Legacy:

Today, the most common physical reminder of the Franciscan presence in many French cities, including Clermont-Ferrand, is a street name like ""Rue des Cordeliers.""
Sometimes, parts of the original convent church or other buildings might survive, incorporated into later structures, or archaeological excavations might reveal foundations.
In Clermont-Ferrand, the original convent structures of the Cordeliers are largely gone, though the street name preserves their memory and location. The site was redeveloped over the centuries.
So, the Franciscan (Cordelier) monastery in medieval Clermont was a vital part of the city's religious, social, and intellectual life for several centuries until its dissolution during the French Revolution.";FAUX

To remedy this situation, a judgement regarding the community's rightful properties was rendered in 991. It appears that this new judgement redounded to the community's benefit, leaving them with considerably greater holdings than they had previously had. According to McMillin, in addition to land-holdings, the convent's endowment included mills, ovens, urban buildings, and at least one market (McMillin, 202). In 1201 Ermessenda joined the community as a nuns, bringing with her a country house with land inherited from her father and 460 sous (McMillin, 207). In 1100 Arbert Bernat and his wife, Ermendgarda, donated four vineyards and their daughter, Ermessenda, to the convent. Bernat Guadalguadi and his wife Adalaide donated a farm and their daughter Sicardi in 1107 (McMillin, 208). The richest donation on behalf of a woman entering Sant Pere occurred in 1262 when Bernat MatarÃ³ and his wife Maria gave their daughter Elicsenda with her paternal and maternal inheritances, 6 vineyards, a piece of land, and 200 morabatins (McMillin, 209). In 1227 Guillem Rosanes donated 3 tracts of land to the community. Pere and Gullema Vilafrancha donated a mansum and one day's income per week from a mill on behalf of their daughter, Arsenda. Ferrera and Pere de Vilafranca gave the monastery 8 pieces of land along with annual rents of money and grain in 1216. In 1247 Ferrer de Vilafranca donated to the convent an annual gift of 10 quarts of grain from a mill, when a third Vilafrancha daughter entered the convent (McMillin, 210).;"6113 ; The site was originally a chapel dedicated to the bishop and martyr S. Sadurni that had been built in 801 to serve the spiritual needs of Charlemagne's troop. A group of young daughters of noble families retired to this chapel in the late 9th century to form a community dedicated to the contemplative life. The community did not have a rule until 945, when Countess Riquilda of Barcelona (wife of Count Sunyer) reorganized the community under the Rule of S. Benedict. It was at that time that both the monastery and a new church were built. Al-Mansur's troops destroyed all of the original buildings and either killed or sold into slavery all of the nuns during the 985 raid on Barcelona, but Count Borrell II and Bishop Vivas of Barcelona re-founded the community the next year. ; The convent joined a loose affiliation of male and female Benedictine houses, the Congregacio Claustral Tarraconense, in the mid-thirteenth century, but this union had little impact on the regular life of the convent (McMillin, 202). The bailiffs of the community appear to rarely have acted without the approval of the abbess (McMillin, 215). Likewise, procurators for the convent never appear to have acted without the approval of the abbess; during the 13th century, Ramon MatarÃ³, Guillem Pinells, and Berenguer de Casals appear as procurators for the convent (McMillin, 216).

Ten women served as abbesses of the community in the 12-13th centuries; half remained in office for over 20 years and 2 served as abbesses for over 40 years (McMillin, 219). Elicsenda, abbess from 1181-1224 locked a bishop out of her parish church in MontmelÃ³ after he excommunicated clerics she had appointed. Guillema de Vilagrant (1227-1246) represented the convent in person at a litigation and called her opponent a liar several times despite his clerical status (!) (McMillin, 220). Ermessenda Pax was elected abbess in 1246 by the compromise method. Zaragoza Pascual has a complete list. ; The convent was involved in litigation over its holdings. The largest controversy involved the parish of Santa Maria of MontmelÃ³. The village of MontmelÃ³ was a dependency of Sant Pere. In addition to tithes and first fruits, the abbess had the right to appoint clergy in the local parish. The rights to income and appointment were challenged in the early 1200's by the bishop of Barcelona both in court and in an armed confrontation (McMillan, 202). The convent also entered into litigation over the inheritence of the estate of Lady Saurina, a widow of Ferrer Suau who became a nun in Sant Pere along with her daughter. Her will divided her estate equally between her three daughters and the convent of Sant Pere. The document was subject to arbitration between the two married daughers and the convent of Sant Pere. In the end, the convent agreed to give up the rights to any land or property that it held because of donations, wills, or entrance gifts from Lady Saurina, but it retained the full paternal inheritance of her daughter, Berenguera, (McMillin, 213-214). ; Benedictine ; Daughters of noble families and wealthy bourgeoisie. The signature lists on documents of the community also provide evidence of the nuns' longevity. Of the nuns in the 12-13th centuries, 66 can confidently be said to have resided within the convent for at least 20 years. Arsenda de Vilafranca lived at Sant Pere for at least 60 years, while Guillema Petra resided in the convent at least 55 years (1191-1246); Brunisenda Sant CabriÃ , ConstanÃ§a Vilar, Elicsenda de Sancto Litero, and Sibilia Vilafranca all lived in the convent for 49 years. None of these women held offices (McMillin, 206). The families of Vilafranca, Pax, and MaterÃ³ had several daughters in residence at Sant Pere. ; In 986, the community consisted of Abbess Adalet and four other nuns (Ermelda, Argudamia, Xintello and Ermentruit). There were 12 nuns by the end of the 10th century, and 20 during the 11th. Documents from the year 1246 provide three identical lists of 49 nuns. A sale in 1286 contains the names of 45 nuns. According to McMillin, 68 names appear in documents from the 12th century and 198 from the 13th century. The average number of nuns in the convent thus hovers between 40-50 from 1240 through 1300. In August 1253 an upper limit of 50 members was set (McMillin, 204-205). ; Sarria (Barcelona) ; The old city ; S. Pere de les Puelles, group of arches,Â S. Pere de les Puelles, column capital (detail),Â S. Pere de les Puelles, church,Â S. Pere de les Puelles, column and capital. The building of the church and monastery have suffered many changes. The 10th century chapel and convent were built in the pre-romanesqe style, but were destroyed in the raid of 985. Members of the community resided around the origina chapel of s. Sadurni between 986 and 1147, when their new home was completed. An upper level was added to the cloister in 1322. Although the cloister was destroyed in the 19th century when the community was supressed, the 12th centiry church remains in use as a parish church. The facades, however, are newer, dating from the 16th century, and constructed in the gothic style. A fragment of the 12th century cloister has been preserved inb the Museu d'Art de Catalunya (Barcelona). Other material remains of the nuns' life can be found in the same museum, as well as in the Alegre de Terrassa collection, the Museu Santacana de Martorell, and the Masia Can Soler fe Vilanove (Vilamajor). Construction of new city walls in the 13th century transformed Sant Pere from a rural to an urban monastery (McMillan, 203). ; The convent came under royal protection in 1183. The MaterÃ³ family served Sant Pere as bailiffs and procurators for several generations in the 13th century. The Rosanes and Vilafrancha families made donations to the community during the 12-13th century on behalf of family members within the convent. Various other catalan counts, bishops and nobles donated large amounts of property, located primarily in the VallÃ¨s Oriental. ; The convent was converted into a prison when the nuns were expelled in 1835, and the cloister was destroyed in 1873, although the church continues to be used as a parish church. ; Received an exemption from Count Ramon Berenguer and Countess Guilia in 1028. ; Jaume Colomer, who donated himself to the abbey in 1286.";FAUX

Situation
Le site est situé à quelques centaines de mètres à l'ouest de la confluence de la Lys et de la Lawe, à 15 km au nord de Béthune, entre Merville et La Gorgue[1].

Histoire
L'abbaye est fondée en 1221 par les seigneurs Robert et Daniel, avoués de Béthune. Elle prend la succession de la collégiale de Lestrem, supprimée avec l'autorisation du pape, et la convertissent en une abbaye de femmes[2].

Dans une charte, Guillaume de Béthune, (Maison de Béthune), avoué d'Arras, dote l'abbaye « récemment érigée », près du moulin de La Gorgue[3].

Le monastère est affilié à l'ordre de Citeaux en 1224.

Il portait le nom de « Beaupré, Bellum Pratum » probablement en raison de l'endroit verdoyant où il se situait. Il semble qu'il succédait à une ancienne abbaye dite de « La Fosse ». Les religieuses se qualifiaient volontiers de « bernardines »[3].

Au XIIIe siècle, l'abbaye reçoit plusieurs dotations de plusieurs seigneurs, dons en argent, terres (terre d'Hinges) ou droits divers ainsi que des parts de dîmes (ex : de la paroisse de Saint-Martin de Tilloy (sans doute l'actuelle Ligny-Thilloy); de Neuve-Chapelle; d'Ecques; La Gorgue;...). Mr Le Glay énumère les différentes chartes qu'il a pu retrouver, d'où il ressort que l'abbaye possédait des biens ou des droits sur plusieurs paroisses environnantes, cause parfois de différents avec d'autres églises (différend entre l'abbaye et l'abbaye Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Chocques au sujet des dîmes et oblations d'Estaires et de La Gorgue, réglé en 1221 par Adam, évêque de Thérouanne)[4].

Les guerres de Religion provoquent la dispersion de la communauté qui revient avant 1588. La guerre entre France et Espagne de 1645 à 1660 est suivie d'une période de paix.

À la Révolution, l'abbaye fut vendue puis entièrement détruite.
C'est actuellement un site archéologique.

L'abbaye, dédiée à Notre-Dame, fut édifiée à l'emplacement d'un ancien oppidum gaulois.

D'autres sources fondent l'abbaye en 1085 suivant le règne de Karle-le-Grand[2]

L'abbaye se retrouve également dans les toponymes de Strumen, Estreu, Estrum et Parthenon Strumensis.

Histoire
L'abbaye fut ruinée par les Normands et rétablie par Gérard II, évêque de Cambrai (1076-1092)[3].
en 1086 Fulçende ou Fulgende (décès le 5 août 1126) fille du duc de Bourgogne, devient abbesse et 21 filles d'une ancienne noblesse dotèrent elles-mêmes la maison.
Lambert, évêque d'Arras en fit confirmer les privilèges par le pape Pascal II. Ces dames n'étaient pas cloitrées ; elles faisaient vœux de chasteté, de pauvreté et d'obéissance.

en 1172 les revenus de l'abbaye était de 22 000 livres.

""Val de Sainte-Aldegonde"" refers to the Valley of Saint Aldegundis.
Order: Carthusian. Importantly, this was a house for nuns (Chartreusines).
Location: Gosnay, in the Pas-de-Calais department, Hauts-de-France region of northern France (historically in the County of Artois).
Foundation: Founded in 1329 by Mahaut, Countess of Artois and Burgundy (Matilda of Artois). She was a very powerful and influential noblewoman, and her patronage ensured a significant start for the monastery.
Dedication: To Sainte-Aldegonde (Saint Aldegundis), a 7th-century Frankish abbess. As with most Carthusian houses, there would also have been a strong devotion to Notre-Dame (Our Lady).
History:
Being a prominent foundation by such a high-ranking noble, it was likely well-endowed.
It would have experienced the general turmoils affecting the region, including the Hundred Years' War and later conflicts.
The Carthusian nuns lived a life of strict enclosure and contemplation.
It was suppressed during the French Revolution (around 1792) and its assets sold.
Current Status:
Parts of the original monastery still exist and are quite impressive. Some buildings have been incorporated into later structures or stand as historical monuments.
The site is recognized for its historical and architectural importance. Some parts might be private property, while others may be accessible or viewable. For instance, the ""Portail de la Chartreuse"" (Charterhouse Gate) and some of the agricultural buildings are notable remnants. The former hostelry is sometimes used for events.
Activities of the Carthusian Nuns at Gosnay in Medieval Times:

The life of the Carthusian nuns at Gosnay would have closely mirrored that of their male counterparts, with adaptations for a female community, all under the Carthusian Rule:

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei):

Solitary Prayer in Cells: The majority of their time was spent in individual cells (small dwellings, though perhaps slightly different in layout than monks' cells). Here, they would recite the Divine Office privately, meditate, and engage in personal prayer.
Communal Prayer: They gathered in the monastery chapel for Conventual Mass (celebrated by a chaplain priest, as nuns cannot be ordained) and for certain hours of the Divine Office chanted in common.
Manual Labor (Ora et Labora):

Within their enclosure and cells, nuns engaged in manual labor suitable for their community. This included:
Textile work: Spinning, weaving, needlework, embroidery (e.g., for altar linens, vestments for the chaplain, or their own habits). This was a very common and important activity for medieval nuns.
Gardening: Tending small gardens for herbs or vegetables.
Manuscript work: Possibly some copying or illuminating of texts, though perhaps less emphasized than in some male monasteries.
Household tasks: Cleaning, light kitchen duties (though heavier tasks might be done by lay sisters or servants if permitted and resources allowed).
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Meditative reading of Scripture, the Church Fathers, and other spiritual writings was essential.
Spiritual Instruction: They would receive spiritual guidance from their Prioress and the chaplains.
Strict Enclosure and Silence:

Carthusian nuns lived under a very strict rule of enclosure, with minimal contact with the outside world.
Silence was a core tenet, observed for most of the day to foster contemplation.
Austere Lifestyle:

Simple diet, often with periods of fasting and abstinence.
Plain, unadorned habits.
A life detached from worldly comforts.
Community Life:

Governed by a Prioress.
Regular meetings in the chapter house for community matters, spiritual exhortation, and mutual correction.
Limited recreational conversation, perhaps during a weekly communal walk within the enclosure if permitted by their specific customs.
The Chartreuse de Gosnay, due to its prestigious foundation and the rigour of its order, would have been a significant spiritual center in Artois during the medieval period.";FAUX

Beginning in 1586, the nuns instituted a system by which an abbess would rule for three years only, then be replaced by another, although many women ended up serving twice, or sometimes even three times.

The end dates of their abbacies are the dates of their death, unless otherwise noted.// 1326-36: Sobriana d'Olzet; 1336-64: Francesca Sa Portella; 1364-75: Sibila de Caixans; 1375-96: Agnes ca Rovira; 1396-1409: Violant de Pallars (died 1418); 1409-11: Isabel March; 1411-24: Saurina Vallseca; 1424-47: Margarida de Montcada; 1447-77: Violant de Centelles; 1477-94: unknown; 1494-95: Violant de Montcada i Lluna (died in 1515, after serving a second term); 1495-1507: Teresa Enriquez (died later, in a convent of Jeronimes [S. Maties?]); 1507-1515: Violand de Montcada i Lluna (2nd term). ; Pedralbes Monastery, exterior,Â Pedralbes Monastery, cloister (view 1), ,Â Pedralbes Monastery, chapter houseÂ andÂ Pedralbes, chapter house (detail). The monastery church (not pictured) is a typical example of the Catalan Gothic style, featuring massive walls with little ornamentation. It is a single nave, with side chapels. Queen Elisenda is buried where the south wall of the church abuts the north wall of the cloister, and her tomb is marked by a funerary sculpture on either side: On the cloister side she is depicted as a nun, while on the church side, she is shown as a queen. ; The monastery possesses many treasures, including a gold-plated silver ""true cross,"" donated to the monastery in the 14th century by its administrator, Monsignor Jaume Despujol. The community's most famous artistic treasure is the group of paintings, dating from 1346, in St. Michael's chapel. Ferrer Bassa painted over two dozen seperate scenes (seeÂ St. Michael's Chapel frescoesÂ andÂ Christ Seated in JudgementÂ for images, and more details about the paintings and the artist). ; In 1897, Sister Eulalia Anzizu produced a history of the house:Â Fulles historiques del Real Monestir de Sta. MarÃ­a de Pedralbes ; Founder, Philip II, Monsignor Jaume Despujol. Enjoyed noble patronage throughout the medieval period, and well beyond. ; The monastery was declared a national historic and artistic monument in 1931. The ajuntament of Barcelona purchased the cloister from the nuns in 1972, building them a new cloister nearby, and converting the old cloister into a museum. ; A small community of Franciscan friars (called the ""conventelet"" or ""conventet"") was founded near the convent during the fourteenth century, and the friars ministered to the nuns' spiritual needs.  Royal Foundation and Patronage:

Queen Elisenda de Montcada: The monastery was founded by Queen Elisenda, the fourth and last wife of King James II of Aragon. This royal patronage was crucial.
Generous Endowment: Unlike many Poor Clare communities that struggled with extreme poverty, Pedralbes was well-endowed by the Queen. This provided a level of material security and allowed for the construction of a magnificent architectural complex. While they still lived the spirit of poverty, their circumstances were different from a small, struggling convent.
Prestige: Royal patronage gave the monastery considerable prestige and attracted daughters from noble families.
Queen Elisenda's Presence: After King James II's death, Queen Elisenda had a palace built next to the monastery and lived there until her own death, actively participating in and overseeing the monastery's life (though not as a nun herself). Her tomb is famously positioned within the church so she could ""see"" the nuns' choir and the altar.
Adherence to the Clarisse Rule (with nuances):

Contemplative Prayer: This remained the absolute core of their life. The Divine Office, Mass, and private prayer structured their days. The stunning Gothic church and beautifully proportioned three-story cloister were designed to facilitate this life of prayer.
Enclosure: Pedralbes maintained strict enclosure. The vastness of the complex, however, meant their ""world"" within the walls was larger and more elaborate than many other convents.
Community Life: Governed by an Abbess, the community would have been relatively large for a Poor Clare monastery, given its prestige.
Poverty: While the monastery as an institution was well-endowed, the individual nuns would still profess vows of poverty, living simply within the community. The interpretation of ""poverty"" in such a well-funded institution would have been a point of discussion and discernment for them.
Manual Labor: Nuns would still engage in manual labor. This could include:
Fine Needlework and Embroidery: Given the noble background of many nuns and the resources available, they likely produced high-quality liturgical vestments and altar linens.
Gardening: The large cloister included a medicinal herb garden.
Management of the Monastery's Affairs: Due to its endowments, there would have been administrative tasks.
Possible Scriptorium Work: While not as central as in Benedictine houses, some manuscript work or care for their library was possible.
Magnificent Architecture and Art:

Catalan Gothic Style: The monastery is a masterpiece of Catalan Gothic architecture, characterized by its spaciousness, light, and elegant simplicity.
Church: A single-nave church designed for the nuns' liturgical needs, with a choir area separated by a grille.
Cloister: One of the largest Gothic cloisters in Europe, providing space for procession, meditation, and access to various monastic buildings.
St. Michael's Chapel: Famous for its exquisite 14th-century murals by Ferrer Bassa, a leading Catalan painter influenced by Sienese art (especially Giotto). These murals depict scenes from the Passion of Christ and the life of the Virgin Mary, providing rich material for the nuns' contemplation.
Other Artworks: Over time, the monastery accumulated a significant collection of religious art, liturgical objects, and furniture.
Life within the Walls:

Cells: Individual cells for the nuns were located around the cloister.
Refectory: The communal dining hall where meals were taken, often in silence while listening to spiritual readings.
Chapter House: For community meetings and governance.
Kitchen, Infirmary, Dormitories (for lay sisters/servants).
Social Composition:

Due to its royal foundation and prestige, many nuns at Pedralbes came from noble and wealthy families of Catalonia. This influenced the monastery's social standing and its connections to the wider Aragonese court and aristocracy.
Challenges and Resilience:

Despite its endowments, the monastery would have faced challenges common to the era: plagues (like the Black Death), political upheavals in the Crown of Aragon, and periods of economic difficulty that might affect their income.
The fact that the monastery has survived for centuries, largely intact, and with its community (until relatively recently for this specific historic building), speaks to its resilience and the enduring commitment of the nuns.
In summary: The Clarisse nuns of Pedralbes in medieval times lived a life rooted in the contemplative ideals of St. Clare, but within an exceptionally beautiful and well-endowed architectural setting provided by royal patronage. Their daily routine of prayer, work, and community life was framed by the magnificent Gothic structures and enriched by significant works of art, like Ferrer Bassa's murals. While they professed poverty, their context was one of aristocratic connections and relative material security, making Pedralbes a unique and important center of female monasticism and culture in medieval Catalonia.";FAUX

Until the Revolution, the priory enjoyed the status of a bailiwick within Paris: a place of tax exemption, a place of exemption from the rules of corporations and a place of asylum for insolvent debtors.

It is known now as the Temple Enclosure and left the Temple name to the district.

Origin
The time when the Knights Templar settled is not well known; they replaced the Old Temple, their first place of residence installed around 1140 opposite the church of Saint-Jean-en-Grève on the site of the current rue de Lobau near the Place de Grève[1]. Jacquemin, archivist of the priory of France, says that the titles relating to this foundation were burned by the Templars at the time of their arrest, but without providing proof[2]. Sauval[3] or Piganiol[4], historians, have found nothing about the origins; as for the Abbé Lebeuf[5], he declares that the house of the Templars was founded during the twelfth century and Cocheris[6] supposes that it already existed when Mathieu de Beaumont donated, in 1152, part of the seigneury of Reuilly and the surrounding lands[7].

Indeed, in 1146, a charter of Simon, bishop of Noyon, found in the commandery of Eterpigny, mentions the presence of a house of the Temple in Paris where the commander and the knights were gathered. Around 1172, Dame Gente gave the Knights Templar possession of a mill with a house above located at Grand-Pont in the censive of the chapter of Notre-Dame, for 30 pounds paid in one go. The act was made in the presence of Maurice, Bishop of Paris, Brother Gaudefroy Fouquier, Master of the Temple below the seas, Brother Eustache Le Chien, Master of the Temple in France, and Brother Jean, Commander in Paris. By letters of Isambert, prior of the church of Saint-Éloi in Paris, dating from 1175, gave and confirmed to the house of the Temple all that it possessed under the cens and customs of use.

History
In 1279, Philip III the Bold signed, by letters patent, an agreement with the Order of the Temple concerning the seigniorial justice that the Order held over its lands. The king recognized that the Order could dispose of high, middle, and low justice over all its property, outside the walls of Paris and then, little by little, within the limits of Paris. In the fourteenth century, the number of cens or ground rents belonging to the Order was so large that it would be necessary to name almost all the streets and squares of Paris.

In 1312, the Order of the Temple was dissolved and its property in France was assigned to the Hospitallers of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem to make it the priory of the Temple. Nevertheless, even if Philip the Fair had ordered";

Soutenue par les papes successifs, l'établissement prospère rapidement. L'abbaye disparait au moment de la Révolution française.

Histoire
Création
Vers 1191, à la fin du XIIe siècle, Christine de Sinneghem (Seninghem), dame de la seigneurie de Ravensberghe, membre de la famille de Seninghem, est la veuve de Willaume Brohon Ier, fils naturel présumé du comte de Flandre Thierry d'Alsace[1], lequel fut inhumé à proximité dans l'abbaye de Watten. La famille de Seninghem et les seigneurs de Ravensberghe possèdent la majorité des territoires des actuelles communes de Merckeghem, Millam, partie sud de Cappelle-Brouck, le reste des terres ayant été accordé au clergé aux XIe et XIIe siècles, à charge pour celui-ci d'assainir cette zone de marais[2]. Quelques religieuses sont déjà regroupées sur un manoir (grande ferme) dénommé Outhof ou Outhove, situé sur Merckeghem dans la seigneurie de Ravensberghe[3], qui appartient à Christine de Sinneghem. Christine leur fait don vers 1191 du bâtiment, de terres attenantes, d'un moulin, de l'ordre de trente- huit mesures (environ dix-sept hectares) de terres et de marais à tourbe, afin qu'elles puissent y construire un monastère[2].

En 1194, la donation de Christine est approuvée par l'archevêque de Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains et par l'évêque de Thérouanne ou évêque des Morins, Lambert de Bruges. Le fils de Christine, Guillaume Brohon II, donne également son accord par écrit[4].

En 1196, le pape Célestin III confirme la donation, annonce la protection du Saint-Siège au couvent, accorde aux religieuses le droit d'élire leur chapelain. Cette intervention pontificale va se répéter à maintes reprises assurant à l'abbaye une protection qui lui permet de se développer.

Le couvent est reçu dans l'ordre de Citeaux. L'abbé de l'abbaye de Clairvaux déclare qu'à la suite de la demande de l'abbé de l'abbaye des Dunes, Ravensberghe est reçu dans cet ordre. L'établissement est placé sous la direction immédiate de l'abbaye de Clairmarais[5]. L'abbaye accepte les novices à partir de l'âge de 16 ans. Toutefois toute nouvelle venue doit apporter une dot[6]. De ce fait, les religieuses appartiennent à des familles aisées

Le monastère bénéficie rapidement de dons ou d'exemptions de taxes cédées par les notables locaux, en particulier les seigneurs de Ravensberghe, les seigneurs de Zinneghem, et la famille détenant la terre de Seninghem, lesquels s'instituent soutiens et protecteurs du nouvel établissement[4]. Les comtes de Flandre successifs la prennent également sous leur protection et lui accordent régulièrement des biens[7].

En 1200, le comte de Flandre Baudouin VI de Hainaut confirme à l'abbaye de Ravensberghe ses biens[8].

En 1205, la comtesse de Flandre Mathilde de Portugal, veuve de Philippe d'Alsace, confirme les différentes donations.

Le pape Innocent IV va réitérer quelque temps plus tard la protection accordée à l'abbaye : il menace d'excommunication ceux commettant des violences ou usurpant les biens de l'établissement[4].

Le prévôt de l'abbaye de Watten contribue à compléter ces différents droits en déclarant que l'abbesse et les religieuses de Ravensberghe ont le droit de nommer et d'instituer leur propre chapelain[5], sans avoir donc à dépendre d'une quelconque autorité extérieure.

Évolution
Au début du XIIIe siècle, l'abbaye continue d'être favorisée par de nombreux seigneurs, ainsi les seigneurs de Boiscure (Buysscheure) : Aélis de Tenremonde, dame de Boiscure, accorde plusieurs biens situés en Flandre en 1209 et Wautier de Boiscure cède une partie de la dîme de Volckerinckhove et d'autres possessions en 1213[9].

En 1227, l'abbé de l'abbaye des Dunes énumère les dons (redevances, cens) faits par le comte de Flandre Ferrand de Flandre et sa femme, Jeanne de Constantinople. Il déclare qu'en retour, les religieuses doivent faire célébrer un anniversaire pour les âmes de leurs bienfaiteurs, ce que les dames de Ravensberghe vont confirmer par une proclamation faite la même année[10].

Dès cette époque, l'abbaye dispose de suffisamment de moyens pour consentir des prêts : Wautier, fils d'Aélis de Drincham engage la moitié de la dîme d'Eringhem contre un prêt de cent livres accordé par l'abbaye, sa mère accorde aux moines une rente sur la dite dîme[11].

En 1230, Grégoire IX confirme l'abbaye dans ses possessions, l'exempte de toute dîme, lui donne le droit de recevoir des biens hérités de ses religieuses, lui accorde l'indépendance par rapport à toute juridiction séculière pour ses biens[9], octroie aux religieuses l'autorisation d'élire leur abbesse et de célébrer le service divin dans leur monastère[12].

En 1249, la comtesse de Flandre Marguerite de Constantinople attribue à son tour cent dix mesures (environ 50 hectares) de terre à l'abbaye[11].

Tous ces dons favorables au couvent ne le préservent pas de toute contestation ou procès : ainsi, en 1273, le curé de Merckeghem, Jean de Rexpoëde, est en conflit avec lui au sujet de certaines dîmes[11]. En 1298, en litige avec le chapitre de Tournai et l'abbaye Saint-Martin de Tournai, à propos de la perception de dîmes (à Mouscron, Reckem, Aelbeke), les parties conviennent de s'en remettre à un arbitrage. Le 12 octobre 1299, l'arbitrage est rendu et le 18 octobre 1299, l'abbé de l'abbaye des Dunes approuve l'accord au nom de l'abbé de Clairvaux[13].

Un évènement particulier marque la vie de l'abbaye : en 1383, l'évêque de Norwich Henri le Despenser mène une expédition militaire en Flandre (Croisade d'Henri le Despenser) et porte atteinte aux intérêts du comte de Flandre Louis de Male. Le roi de France Charles VI vient au secours du comte et lors de cette campagne loge une nuit à l'abbaye[14].

Alors que les seigneurs de Ravensberghe s'attachent généralement à favoriser l'établissement, certains se distinguent en lui causant des ennuis : en 1466, Nicolas de Mailly, dit Payen, a des relations orageuses avec l'abbaye : lui et son serviteur Willem Rabat font l'objet d'une condamnation pour violences et outrages envers l'abbesse et les religieuses de Ravensberghe. En 1466, Nicolas de Mailly obtient du duc de Bourgogne comte de Flandre Philippe le Bon des lettres de rémission, entérinées par le conseil de Flandre à Gand[15].

À partir du XIIIe siècle, les chartes portent au dos une analyse sommaire de l'objet et du contenu ainsi que le numéro occupé par le document dans le cartulaire élaboré à cette époque, il s'agit d'une amorce d'un système archivistique dans la région[16].

En 1517, Charles Quint délivre à l'abbaye des lettres d'amortissement, contenant le démembrement de toutes les terres et rentes acquises par l'établissement pendant les quarante ans précédents[17].

En 1525, l'abbé de Clairmarais, Jacques Dupont, malade, se retire en l'abbaye d'Outhove où il décède le 23 mai 1525[18]. Il est ramené à Clairmarais pour y être inhumé

Le 24 juin 1561, l'abbesse Jacqueline de la Tour, vend du consentement de sa communauté, à l'évêque de Saint-Omer, des propriétés et un refuge détenus dans la ville de Saint-Omer, aux fins de création du collège Saint-Bertin, lequel existe encore de nos jours[19].

En 1568, l'abbaye et l'église voisine de Merckeghem sont pillées lors de la crise iconoclaste liée à la révolte des Gueux[20].

En 1653, l'établissement d'Outhove cède un terrain, d'environ deux hectares, détenu à Dunkerque au profit de l'installation d'un couvent de Carmes déchaussés, pour un montant de six mille florins. Cette terre provenait d'un don de la comtesse de Flandre Jeanne de Constantinople, confirmé par sa sœur Marguerite par lettres données à Bruges en novembre 1249[21]. Le paiement pris en charge par un protecteur de l'ordre des Carmes s'effectue par un versement comptant, des traites à échéance et un tableau d'une valeur de cent livres destiné au maître-autel de l'abbaye. En 1670, l'affaire suscite un litige entre les deux instances religieuses, différend réglé par la passation d'un compromis le 26 mai 1670[22].

Aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles, à l'instar de la majorité des établissements religieux au cours de leur histoire, l'abbaye mène plusieurs procès contre des possesseurs, laïcs ou religieux, de terres ou de dîmes lui devant des rentes ou autres sommes d'argent ou contestant avoir à le faire[6].

Au XVIIIe siècle, le couvent s'oppose à l'évêque de Saint-Omer Joseph-Alphonse de Valbelle-Tourves lequel revendique le droit de visiter les novices des abbayes liées à Clairvaux. Il rencontre l'opposition de l'abbesse de Ravensberghe, de l'Abbaye Sainte-Colombe de Blendecques et de l'abbé de l'abbaye de Clairvaux. Le roi tranche en faveur de l'évêque en 1733[6].

Selon une enquête de 1750, l'abbaye est un des établissements religieux les plus riches de la châtellenie de Bourbourg : elle détient 665 mesures soit environ 300 hectares et bénéficie de 4105 livres de revenus venant de propriétés disséminées à travers la région[23]. Ces biens vont encore augmenter jusqu'en 1792 comme l'indiquent les registres au moment de la disparition de l'établissement. L'abbaye possédait un refuge (habitation destinée à servir de lieu de repli en cas de menaces lors d'une guerre) à Saint-Omer[24].

Disparition
En vue des États généraux de 1789, se tient à Bailleul le 31 mars 1789 la réunion des membres du clergé de la Flandre maritime présidée par l'évêque d'Ypres Charles Alexander d'Arberg. L'abbaye est représentée par un dénommé Bertrandi[25], archidiacre et vicaire général à Saint-Omer[26].

Le 27 février 1790, en application d'un décret de l'Assemblée nationale en date du 13 novembre 1789, l'abbaye déclare la liste de ses biens et les charges dont le couvent est grevé[27].

En 1790, la commune de Merckeghem somme les religieuses de faire disparaître les armoiries qui sont dans leur église et les invite à ne plus rentrer dans l'église paroissiale avec des chiens pendant le service divin[28].

Le 3 novembre 1790 est dressé l'état des meubles, effets et bibliothèque de l'abbaye[29].

Dès avril 1791, on commence à vendre au profit de la Nation des biens ou les avêties (récoltes sur pieds) venant de l'abbaye[30].

Le 15 mai 1791, les religieuses demandent au directoire du district de Bergues de leur abandonner un terrain adjacent à leur enclos afin que celles préférant mener la vie en communauté puissent s'y retirer. La municipalité de Merckeghem émet un avis défavorable sur cette demande le 27 juillet 1971. La même année, une novice de l'abbaye réclame la somme qu'elle a versé en entrant dans le couvent , celui-ci ne pouvant plus remplir son office. La suite donnée à ces demandes n'est pas connue[30].

La dissolution de l'abbaye est notifiée aux religieuses le 15 septembre 1792[30]. Elle compte à cette date 28 religieuses. Celles-ci en sortent le mois même[6]. Elles disposent à cette date d'un revenu de 23334 francs[31].

Dans la matinée du 14 octobre 1792, un commencement d'incendie a lieu dans le couvent, dont on a commencé à liquider les biens[28]. Les édifices sont vendus et démolis. L'abbaye comptait trois cloches. Elle possédait environ 3 kg d'argenterie (objets sacrés ou d'usage courant). L'argenterie est envoyée au district de Bergues pour être ensuite acheminée à Lille[31]. Une partie des archives est dirigée vers le district de Bergues, le reste est récupéré par des particuliers[32]. De ce fait, elles sont dispersées et seules en subsistent quelques chartes[14]. Certaines ont été envoyées en 1799 à la bibliothèque Richelieu (depuis Bibliothèque nationale de France)[33],[34].

La vente des biens intervient à la suite du départ des religieuses : les bâtiments du couvent, l'église, les annexes, un moulin, quatre fermes, de l'ordre de 874 mesures de terre (environ 400 hectares). Les acquéreurs sont nombreux, on retrouve un meunier intéressé par le moulin, le prêtre du village et plusieurs agriculteurs des villages des environs[35].";FAUX

Although some gothic elements are still visible, especially in the interior, the exterior has been much altered, and contains elements from several different periods. ; Verge de la SerraÂ (virgin of the hill), patron saint of the town (See alsoÂ Mar de Deu de la Serra, apse sculpture). 1. The ""Mare de Déu de la Serra"" Devotion:

Meaning: This title typically refers to a sanctuary or image of the Virgin Mary located on a hill or mountain overlooking a town or region. She is seen as a protectress, a beacon, and a refuge.
Local Importance: Devotion to a ""Mare de Déu de la Serra"" would be strong in the specific locality where the monastery was situated. The nuns would share in and foster this local piety.
Influence on the Monastery:
Their monastery church or chapel would likely house a prominent statue or painting of ""Mare de Déu de la Serra.""
Special feasts and prayers related to this Marian title would be observed with particular solemnity.
The nuns would see themselves under the special patronage and protection of Our Lady of the Mountain.
2. Core Life as Clarisse (Poor Clares):
This would follow the Rule of St. Clare, which was universal for all Poor Clare communities:

Radical Poverty: No individual or corporate ownership of property. They relied on alms (charity from the local population) and the work of their own hands.
Contemplative Prayer: This was their main ""activity"" and purpose.
Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office): Chanted in choir at set times throughout the day and night.
Holy Mass: Attended daily, celebrated by a Franciscan friar or other approved priest.
Mental Prayer & Meditation: Time for personal prayer and reflection.
Strict Enclosure (Cloister): Nuns lived their entire lives within the monastery walls, with very limited contact with the outside world, usually through a grille or a ""turn"" (a revolving window for passing items). This was to foster an environment of prayer and detachment.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess, sharing meals (often in silence with spiritual reading), work, and prayer.
Manual Labor: Essential for their simple sustenance and as a spiritual discipline. In medieval Spain, this could include:
Spinning and Weaving: Spain was known for its wool. They would produce cloth for their habits and other simple textiles.
Needlework and Embroidery: Making and mending their own clothing, altar linens. Spanish convents often became known for fine embroidery, though simplicity was key for Poor Clares.
Gardening: Cultivating vegetables, fruits, and herbs in their cloister garden.
Baking: Making their own bread.
Making Sweets/Confectionery (possibly): While this became a more prominent tradition in later centuries for many Spanish convents as a source of income, its roots might be found in medieval times for special occasions or simple needs.
Penance and Austerity: A life of simplicity, fasting, and other penitential practices was integral.";FAUX

Name: Abbaye Notre-Dame de Landais
Order: Cistercian
Location: Frédille, Indre department, France.
Foundation:
It was founded around 1115 by Martin de Fougères (or Foulgères), initially perhaps as a hermitage or a small Benedictine community.
It formally became a Cistercian abbey around 1129, affiliating with L'Aumône Abbey (itself a daughter house of Cîteaux), making it part of the Cistercian expansion.
Dedication: Notre-Dame (Our Lady), which was the standard dedication for almost all Cistercian abbeys.
History:
The abbey prospered in the 12th and 13th centuries, acquiring lands and establishing granges (outlying agricultural estates managed by lay brothers).
It suffered significantly during the Hundred Years' War (14th-15th centuries), which ravaged many parts of France.
It experienced further decline during the French Wars of Religion (16th century).
Like many French monasteries, it was eventually placed in commendam, where an abbot (often a layman or a cleric not residing at the abbey) would receive its revenues, often leading to neglect of the spiritual life and buildings.
It was suppressed during the French Revolution in 1791, and its assets were sold off as national property. The buildings were largely dismantled for stone.
Current Status:
Significant ruins of the abbey remain today. These include parts of the abbey church (notably the facade, parts of the nave, and the transept), the chapter house, and other monastic buildings.
The site is a monument historique (classified historical monument) and is recognized for its architectural and historical importance.
It is typically privately owned, and access might be limited or by appointment/during specific heritage days.
Activities of the Monks at Abbaye de Landais in Medieval Times:

As a Cistercian abbey, life at Landais would have been governed by the Rule of St. Benedict and the specific Cistercian customs emphasizing simplicity, austerity, manual labor, and a return to the literal observance of the Rule.

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei - Work of God):

The monks (choir monks) dedicated many hours daily to the Divine Office, chanted in the abbey church. This included services throughout the day and night (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline).
Daily Conventual Mass.
Manual Labor (Ora et Labora - Pray and Work):

Cistercians emphasized self-sufficiency through manual labor.
Choir Monks: Engaged in work within the cloister, such as gardening, manuscript copying in the scriptorium, and crafts.
Lay Brothers (Conversi): This was a crucial element of Cistercian life. Lay brothers took vows but were primarily dedicated to manual labor. They worked the abbey's lands, managed the granges (agricultural estates often located at some distance from the abbey), tended livestock, worked in mills, forges, and workshops. Their labor freed the choir monks for prayer and study. Landais, like other Cistercian abbeys, would have been involved in agriculture, land reclamation, and possibly forestry or viticulture depending on the local conditions.
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Lectio Divina (Sacred Reading): Monks spent time in private reading and meditation on scripture and the writings of the Church Fathers.
Scriptorium: Cistercian abbeys were important centers for copying manuscripts, thus preserving knowledge and providing texts for their own use and sometimes for other houses.
Study and theological reflection.
Community Life:

Living under the authority of an Abbot.
Communal meals in the refectory (often in silence, with a reading).
Meetings in the Chapter House for community business, spiritual instruction, and public confession of faults.
Sleeping in a common dormitory.
Simplicity and Austerity:

Cistercian architecture was famously unadorned, avoiding elaborate decoration or sculpture.
Simple diet, often vegetarian, with regular fasts.
Plain clothing (undyed wool habits, hence ""White Monks"").

Carthusians in Toulouse:

Yes, there was a significant Chartreuse de Toulouse. Its full name was often Chartreuse de Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci de Toulouse.
It was founded relatively late, in 1569, by the ""Confrérie des Pèlerins de Saint-Jacques"" (Confraternity of Pilgrims of St. James), though the actual construction and establishment of the Carthusians took some years, with the first stone of the church laid around 1602-1612. So, its main period of activity is more early modern than strictly medieval.
It was located in the Saint-Cyprien quarter of Toulouse.
Like other Carthusian houses in France, it was suppressed during the French Revolution (1791).
The buildings were later used for various purposes, including as an arsenal and military barracks. Some parts were demolished, others repurposed. The former refectory became the church of Saint-Pierre des Chartreux.";FAUX

However, this was much disputed by the monks at St. Gregory's, Canterbury, who claimed that they had taken ownership of the relics during the reign of Archbishop Lanfranc.

Sometime after 1200 it was inhabited by Lena (Leva), daughter of Godric de Lynne. Due to the placement of the priory, which was founded on fenland that was later reclaimed to marshland, it is possible that the priory may have had an anchoretic origin (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 220). According to some accounts, Lena purposely founded the priory where there was ""no human habitation.""The Victoria History of the County of Sussex2:408-10 The land on which the priory was built was given to frequent flooding and at some point the priory may have been abandoned save for one nun, Joan, who lived in the cemetery of S.

At the time of it's suppression, the nuns of Crabhouse were accused (by Cromwell's visitors John ap Rice and Dr. Legh) of engaging in a number of sins. The abbess was accused of fathering a child along with two other nuns (one of whom was accused of giving birth to a child fathered by a priest).

According to the prioress at the time, Elizabeth Bredon, the house was in debt for 10 marks but was owed 5 marks. In addition, all the nuns were found to be in good standing aside from one Agnes Smyth. The nuns complained that confession was infrequent and the prioress was ordered to make time for more confession. Also, the nuns reported that the chapel roof was in disrepair. Six years later, during the tenure of Margaret Studefeld, another visitation was made but the report was satisfactory. ; The house and garden on the site of the convent contain fragments of medieval masonry; associated finds include pottery, metalwork, carved stone and human remains, which were recorded in the eighteenth century (Gilchrist/Oliva, 85). A survey of 1557 described the dimensions of the buildings and courts which remained at that date. The precinct contained two large courts or yards to the west and north of the original cloister, of one acres and three roods respectively (Gilchrist/Oliva, 85). The west range and cloister of the original priory were retained after the Dissolution. The range was ordered as a hall with upper and lower ends, and the chamber with solar at the upper end corresponds with details given for the construction of the prioress's lodgings in 1422 (Gilchrist/Oliva, 86). The survey of 1557 also described several of the outbuildings which dated to the occupation of the priory, such as an old mill house and old little storehouse. The parson's lodgings consisted of a chamber, buttery and kitchen, adjoining the old steeple. The nunnery church was demolished by 1557, but the steeple and churchyard to the south-east were noted. The church appears to have formed the south range of the cloister. Entrance to the nave was from the south-west. In the survey, roofing materials were noted, including slate, tile, and reed (Gilchrist/Oliva, 86).

There were further visitations in 1514, 1526, 1532. ; The convent was built on marshy ground to the south of the town walls of Norwich. According to nineteenth-century excavations (On the Excavation of the Site of Carrow Abbey, Norwich) and the alignment of the chancel and nave, construction began from the east of the church in the mid-twelfth century, and the nave was completed in the early thirteenth century (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 83-4). The blank arcading of the interior of the church survives partially. On the north side of the chancel was the chapel to S. Catherine; to the south are foundations of the chapel dedicated to S. John the Baptist. There was another chapel further south. The sacristry projected east from the transept and was entered from the transept through a doorway with refined mouldings and shafts (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 84). Beyond the south transept was a slype containing remains of a circular stairway, which probably served as the night-stairs of the nuns. The chapter house extended beyond the east range. The day-stairs of the nuns were located to the south of the chapter-house. A portion of the dormitory wall retains the doorway which led from the day-stairs to the cloister. The east range is represented by an extant west wall; this was the location of the dormitory, which extended south beyond the limit of the rectangular cloister. Attached to the east range, immediately south of the chapter-house, are the foundtions of a small structure thought to represent the latrine-block. Fragments of masonry to the east of the cloister, at the edge of the River Wensum, may represent the infirmary (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 84). The west range was rebuilt by the Prioress Isabel Wygun in the sixteenth century and is still extant. It was restored between 1899-1909. Restitivity survey indicated that the cloister was re-ordered, with the demolition of the original west range in order to build the prioress's lodge. Twelve burials from the church and its graveyard to the north have been excavated. One of the graves was that of a priest. With the exception of the priest and a child, all the burials were of adult women. A thirteenth-century cooking pot was also found on the site. The church is unusually large for a female house. The church, chapter-house projecting from the range and the dormitory extended beyond the cloister, all indicate a house of unique status within the women's communities of medieval East Anglia (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 85). ; Two seals remain (seeÂ On the Excavation of the Site of Carrow Abbey, NorwichÂ for image), one from the twelfth century that depicts S. Mary and child and the fleur-del-lis. The second seal comes from the thirteenth century, and it depicts the same Mary and child with the Prioress kneeling, holding a scroll. There is also stain glass from this priory. However, Dugdale lists 4 seals. ; One entry states that the house was founded in 1146 by Seyna and Lescelina, ""sorores moniales de hospite Sancte Marie et Sancte Johannie in Norwich."" The existence of such an establishment is confirmed by a charter of King Stephen referring to a grant of his to the church of S. Mary and S. John. He gave the nuns 25 shillings worth of land and expressed the wish that they should found their church on this site. His charter was drawn up circa 1136-1137, ten years before the date of foundation for Carrow. Such a discrepancy would be explained if the nunnery developed from an earlier institution (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 49). ; An elaborately illuminated psalter which belonged to Carrow includes a series of full-frame illustrations of important female saints (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 53). ; The crown and Warenne are thought to have been patrons, but further research is necessary to veify this. King Stephen was a patron before 1146. Other benefactors were Reginald di Warenne, and his wife, Alice; William di Warenne and his sister, Muriel, who was a nun; and Richard Segrim. In the 12th century there were many small donations. Before 1237Â Margaret de CheyneyÂ acted as a patron; Agnes Thorpe was a benefactor around 1500, and Margery Dogett patronized the community in 1516.

The abundance of limestone may relate to the earlier occupation of the site by Bury St. Edmunds while river transport was still possible (Religious Women in Medieval East Anglia: History and Archaeology c. 1100-1540., 88). Extensive remains of the twelfth century and later indicate an aisleless church with south trnsept, with portions of the chapter-house surviving to the south of the transept. The transept is entered through a wide two-centered arch with Norman respond scallop capitals. In the south-east corner of the transept there is a staircase to the upper storey of the east range that would have been the night-stairs for the nuns. The south wall of the church appears to be original twelfth-century fabric. Two blocked openings south of the transept suggest entrances to the church from the cloister alleys. Much of the north wall appears to have been rebuilt in the fifteenth century. Fifteenth-century fabric includes two large windwos in the north wall and one in the south transept east wall. A structure to the south of the cloister, a two-story building in ashlar with a cell attached to the north end, may have been an infirmary (Gilchrist/Oliva, 88).

Shouldham Priory in Norfolk, England, was indeed a significant Gilbertine double monastery.

Here's what you should know about it:

The Gilbertine Order:

As we've discussed, this was the only purely English monastic order, founded by St. Gilbert of Sempringham in Lincolnshire.
Its most distinctive feature was its ""double houses"" for both canons (men, following an Augustinian-based rule) and nuns (women, following a Cistercian-influenced rule), along with lay brothers and lay sisters. They had separate cloisters but typically shared a church, which was internally divided to maintain strict enclosure.
Foundation of Shouldham Priory:

Founder: Geoffrey FitzPeter, Earl of Essex. He was a very powerful and influential figure, serving as Chief Justiciar of England under Richard I and King John.
Date: Founded relatively late for a Gilbertine house, generally dated to c. 1190-1198.
Purpose: It was founded for the souls of himself, his first wife Beatrice de Say (who was buried there), and his family. Such foundations were common acts of piety and a way for wealthy patrons to ensure prayers for their lineage.
Dedication: The priory was dedicated to the Holy Cross and the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Nature and Importance:

Double House: It was established from the outset as a double monastery for canons and nuns.
Wealth and Size: Shouldham Priory became one of the largest and wealthiest Gilbertine houses. Its endowments were considerable, reflecting the status of its founder.
Economy: The priory's wealth would have come from extensive landholdings, agricultural produce (including sheep farming for wool), rents, and other donations.
The Dissolution of the Monasteries:

Like all monastic institutions in England, Shouldham Priory was suppressed during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries.
Given its wealth, it was among the larger houses to be dissolved. It was surrendered to the Crown in 1538 (some sources say 1539).
At the time of its surrender, records indicate a community consisting of the prior, 10 canons, 2 lay brothers, and 15 nuns.
The lands and properties were confiscated by the Crown and then granted or sold to laypeople. Sir John Fineux and Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, were among those who benefited from its lands.
What Remains Today:

Unlike Alvingham, where the canons' church became the parish church, the great priory church of Shouldham itself is gone.
The site of the priory is located to the west of the current village of Shouldham.
Earthworks and buried archaeological remains are the primary evidence of the priory's extensive layout. These can indicate the outlines of the church, cloisters, and other buildings.
Some stonework from the priory was likely reused in local buildings. Fragments of carved stone are sometimes found.
The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
The nearby parish church of St. Margaret in Shouldham predates the priory and was separate from it, though the priory would have had a significant impact on the local area.
In summary, Shouldham Priory was a major and wealthy Gilbertine double monastery in Norfolk, founded by a powerful nobleman. It thrived for over 300 years before its suppression during the Dissolution. Today, its presence is marked by archaeological remains and earthworks rather than substantial standing ruins.";FAUX

It was one of three such houses in Norwich. See alsoÂ Sisters (2)Â andÂ Sisters (3). ; Sisters, number unknown ; Norwich ; Located in the parish of S. Swithin's, in the house or tenement of John Pellet , Pyllet. ; William Setman was a benefactor in 1429. ; Testament?/ testament. Sisters (1) – usually cited in medieval Latin as sorores poenitentiae Norwici, the “Penitent Sisters of Norwich” – were a very small, short-lived female house belonging to the obscure Order of Penance of Jesus Christ (the so-called “Sack-cloth Friars/Friesses”).  Norwich is almost the only English place where a community of women of the order can be proved to have existed.

1.  Identity and order  
• Official name: sorores (or domus sororum) de poenitentia Jesu Christi; English antiquaries call them “Penitent Sisters”, sometimes “Sisters of the Sack”.  
• Rule/observance: a mendicant reform approved by Innocent III (1212) and Gregory IX (1228).  Members wore undyed sack-cloth, went barefoot, owned no property in common and lived largely on alms.  The male branch are the better known “Friars of the Sack”; the Norwich sisters were their female counterpart.  
• Dedication: not stated in the documents; many houses of the order elsewhere were placed under St Mary Magdalene, but at Norwich the patron is unknown.

2.  Foundation and brief existence  
• First appearance: will of Agnes de Hempnall, widow of a Norwich merchant, dated 11 May 1268, leaves 12 pence “sororibus de penitentia in Norwico”.  A second bequest (3 shillings) occurs in the will of John de Knapton, 1272.  
• Likely foundation c. 1265–1268, probably by a local merchant family that also helped the male Sack Friars who were already in the city by 1250.  
• The Council of Lyons (1274) ordered all minute mendicant orders to dissolve or merge with the four great orders.  A papal mandate of 8 June 1276 empowered the bishop of Norwich to “receive the sisters of the Penance into some approved rule or dismiss them to their homes”.  Nothing further is heard of them after that decade, so the house almost certainly disappeared before 1280.

3.  Site  
• No building survives and the exact plot is uncertain.  A 14th-century rental of the Cathedral Priory (now Norfolk Record Office, DCN 41/5, f. 12r) refers retrospectively to “terra ubi fuit domus sororum de poenitentia, juxta pontem Conesford” – “the land where the Sisters of Penance used to be, next to Conesford bridge”.  That places them in the southern suburb, near today’s King Street–Carrow Bridge area on the west bank of the River Wensum.  
• An 1887 sewer trench near Thorn Lane uncovered mortared flint footings, coarse-ware cooking-pots and a buckle of 13th-century type; these may or may not belong to the lost convent.

4.  Size and way of life (inferences)  
• Numbers: contemporary analogues on the Continent rarely housed more than a dozen sisters; Norwich was probably similar (perhaps 6-10 women plus one or two priests serving them).  
• Income: entirely alms.  The tiny legacies noted above, a weekly dole of bread ordered by Alderman Richard de Berstrete (d. 1271) and the right to beg inside the city gates on Fridays are the only economic references.  
• Works: the rule obliged members to nurse the sick poor “when prudent” and to pray for benefactors, but there is no local evidence for an infirmary; the sisters mostly lived an enclosed life of fasting, manual labour and the Divine Office.

5.  Dissolution and aftermath  
• Between 1276 and c. 1280 the Norwich Penitent Sisters fade from every surviving city, diocesan or royal record.  
• Their site became copyhold land of the cathedral priory and by 1312 was let as a market garden; nothing indicates any transfer of the community to another order.  Individual sisters may have joined the Poor Clares newly arrived at nearby Bruisyard (Suffolk) or simply returned to lay life.

7.  In one sentence  
The “Sisters (Penitents) of Norwich” were a tiny community of sack-cloth-clad mendicant women founded c. 1268, suppressed within a dozen years under the general abolition of the minor penitential orders, and now remembered only in a handful of wills and a single rental note.";FAUX

The Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John of Jerusalem):

A medieval Catholic military order founded to care for sick and poor pilgrims in Jerusalem.
It quickly became militarized, playing a crucial role in the Crusades and defending Christian territories.
To fund their activities in the Holy Land (and later Rhodes, then Malta), they established estates (commanderies/preceptories) across Europe.
Carbrooke Commandery (or Preceptory):

Foundation: Founded around 1173 by Maud, Countess of Clare (or her son, Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford). It was one of the earliest Hospitaller foundations in England.
Dedication: Dedicated to St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the Order.
Significance: Carbrooke became one of the most important and wealthiest Hospitaller commanderies in England. It was sometimes referred to as the ""Grand Commandery of Carbrooke,"" indicating its status. It served as an administrative center for other Hospitaller properties in the region.
Activities of a Hospitaller Commandery like Carbrooke:

Estate Management (Primary Function):
Managing extensive agricultural lands, woods, and other properties.
Collecting rents, tithes, and other revenues from their estates.
Overseeing farming, livestock (especially sheep for wool, a major medieval commodity), and other economic activities.
The primary goal was to generate income to support the Order's military campaigns, hospitals, and charitable work in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Sending Revenue (""Responsions""): A significant portion of the income generated was sent as ""responsions"" to the Order's central treasury.
Recruitment: Commanderies acted as recruiting centers for men wishing to join the Order as knights (nobles) or sergeants-at-arms (commoners).
Hospitality: They provided lodging and sustenance for travelers, especially members of the Order, dignitaries, and pilgrims. This was in line with their original charism of hospitality.
Spiritual Life: The commander (the knight in charge) and any resident chaplains would maintain a religious life, with daily prayers, Mass in their chapel, and observance of the Order's rule.
Local Charity: While their main focus was overseas, they often provided some level of care for the local poor and sick, though perhaps not as extensively as dedicated hospitals run by other orders.
Administrative Hub: The Commander of Carbrooke would have overseen other smaller Hospitaller holdings in the region.
Burial Place: Like many religious houses, their chapel and grounds could serve as a burial place for benefactors and local gentry.
""Carbrooke Watching"" or ""Little Watching"":

Carbrooke was particularly famous for a special religious observance and pilgrimage known as the ""Carbrooke Watching"" or ""Little Watching.""
This was associated with a significant relic (sometimes said to be a finger of St. John the Baptist, though other sources mention a revered crucifix).
Pilgrims would come to venerate the relic or image, especially on certain feast days, bringing offerings and prestige to the commandery. This was a unique feature that boosted Carbrooke's income and fame.
Suppression:

The Order of St. John of Jerusalem in England was suppressed by King Henry VIII in 1540, slightly later than the dissolution of most monasteries. Their property was confiscated by the Crown.
The Carbrooke Commandery's estates were granted to figures like Sir Richard Gresham and later Sir John Dudley (Duke of Northumberland).

Tout a commencé au début du XIIème siècle où des religieuses cisterciennes de Nesle-Hodeng, provenant de l’abbaye de Bival (wiki), s’installent au Camp Souverain. Elles y établissent alors une chapelle Sainte-Marie Madeleine. Par quelles motivations ? Pourquoi ici ? Aucune idée. Peut-être était-ce un territoire peuplé où l’ordre religieux cistercien était absent. La même chose à cette même époque à été réalisé à Bondeville par les religieuses de Nesle-Hodeng. Ces 2 lieux avaient-ils des points communs à cette époque ? Contexte : l’impératrice Mathilde
Petit rappel du contexte, Saint-Saëns est sous duché de Normandie. Duché chapeauté à l’époque par l’impératrice Mathilde (wiki), qui est alors duchesse et non plus impératrice depuis 1125. Elle se consacre de plus en plus à sa foi et aux domaines religieux, quels que soient les ordres et courants de pratiques religieuses. Bon. Encore arrêter fallait-il en finir de gérer une guerre en Angleterre, des conflits diplomatiques et des embrouilles familiales. Elle rentre à Rouen, d’Angleterre, en 1148 pour gérer son duché de Normandie. Mais elle ne rentre pas seule. Elle revient avec un intérêt particulier pour l’ordre de Cîteaux (dit cistercien), très présent en Angleterre. Elle se rapproche alors les rares monastères cisterciens normands – dont Mortemer – pour pouvoir propulser d’autres monastères du même ordre ici et là, au nom de la Vierge Marie. Comme celui de Saint-Saëns.

Le prieuré cistercien de Saint-Saëns
Sa construction fut honorée par de nombreux dons et aumônes pour les religieuses dont de nombreuses terres : Mont-Varenne, Pont du Thil, champs de Langlée, fief d’Equiqueville, fief de Saint-Martin Lhortier. Quand à l’actuel Bois de l’Abbaye, il aurait déjà fait partie du terrain du monastère. André Lejeune (1930) donne l’année 1167 comme date la plus tardive des débuts officiels du prieuré près de la Varenne. Cette année correspond au décès de l’impératrice Mathilde. Elle n’aura peut-être pas connu de son vivant l’activité du monastère, mais aura participé de son vivant à sa création. Le prieuré est donc construit entre 1144 et 1167.

Built between 1183 and 1208, the Romanesque church was founded by Queen Sancha of Castile, wife of Alfonso II of Aragon.[1]

The convent church is based on the shape of the Latin cross. It has a single nave, a wide transept and three apse chapels. There are also elements from Cistercian and Mudéjar architecture such as in the roofs and windows. The main entrance portal features fourteen archivolts.

History
The convent was operated by the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. It flourished in the 14th century thanks to royal support but declined after the crown of Aragon merged with Castile. Several royal burials were made in the convent church, including Sancha of Castile, Queen of Aragon, who lived out her last years and died there after being marginalized by her son Pedro II of Aragon, who is also interred there along with two of his sisters.

In 1835, after the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal deprived it of most of its revenues, the convent was abandoned by its religious community, although some nuns later returned. The Romanesque convent was largely destroyed by fire in 1936 by anti-clerical Anarchist militiamen in the Spanish Civil War. Restoration of the convent began in the 1950s. The Romanesque cloister was restored in 1974. Artworks still in place include the royal tombs of Sancha and Peter of Aragon, while the former abbess' throne was moved to the Lleida Museum.

In 1985 nuns from the Sisterhood of Bethlehem took over the convent.

Major artworks
The church contains royal tombs of the House of Aragon. The Romanesque cloister, once in ruins, owes its current appearance to a 1974 reconstruction. Artworks still in place include the royal tombs of Sancha and Peter of Aragón, while the former abbess' throne is in the Diocesan and Comarcal Museum of Lleida.

The chapter house housed extremely important Romanesque frescos of about 1200 by largely English artists, probably including some of those who produced the Winchester Bible; this was only realized after their destruction. The artists also appear to have visited Palermo before Sigena, as some influence from mosaics there can be seen. The frescos had been fully photographed in black and white shortly before their destruction, and the remaining damaged sections, mostly having lost their colour, were moved to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona in 1936.[2]

The Master of Sigena (Maestro de Sigena) is an early 16th-century painter who painted a large altarpiece for the church between 1510 and 1521, panels from which are now exhibited at the Prado Museum in Madrid, the Museum of Santa Cruz (Toledo) and the museum in Zaragoza.



Artefacts dispute
Although the Monastery of Sigena, the royal pantheon of Aragon, was declared a National Monument, later, in 1923, much of its art was taken to Catalonia. It began with the stripping of the unique Romanesque paintings (13th century) from the chapter house during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.

In April 2015 and July 2016, two Spanish courts ruled that MNAC and the Generalitat de Catalunya had to return the murals and 97 works of art and objects stored or exhibited in the MNAC and in the Lleida Museum.

Even though it was mandatory to comply with the court rulings, only 51 pieces of the 97 from the monastery have been returned. The mural paintings from the chapter house still remain in the MNAC. A Social Platform (www.sijenasi.com) was created in order achieve the return of the assets from the Monastery of Sigena. In December 2017, the Spanish government began removing the remaining artefacts from museums in Catalonia.[3]";

Carthusian life is unique among monastic orders for its emphasis on solitary contemplation combined with a communal framework. Here's what the monks at Le Puy-St-Jean would have been doing:

Prayer and Liturgy (The Opus Dei - Work of God):

Solitary Prayer in Cells: The vast majority of a Carthusian monk's time was spent in his individual cell (a small house with a garden). Here, he would recite most of the Divine Office privately, meditate, and engage in personal prayer.
Communal Prayer: They would gather in the monastery church for certain parts of the Divine Office (like Night Office/Matins & Lauds, and Vespers) and for the daily Conventual Mass. Silence was paramount even during communal activities.
Manual Labor (Ora et Labora - Pray and Work):

Within the Cell: Each monk had a workshop in his cell and would engage in manual labor. This could include:
Gardening: Cultivating a small garden attached to his cell for food or herbs.
Crafts: Woodworking, bookbinding, tailoring their own habits, or other simple crafts necessary for the community's self-sufficiency or for personal discipline.
Lay Brothers: Carthusian communities also included lay brothers (conversi). These brothers lived a slightly less eremitical life and were responsible for the more substantial manual labor needed to sustain the monastery, such as:
Farming on any monastery lands (though Carthusians typically had less extensive landholdings than, say, Cistercians).
Kitchen duties.
Maintenance of buildings.
Dealing with the outside world for necessary supplies.
This allowed the choir monks (the priests and those destined for priesthood) to maintain their solitude.
Intellectual and Spiritual Work:

Reading and Study (Lectio Divina): Monks would spend significant time reading and meditating on Scripture, the writings of the Church Fathers, and other spiritual texts.
Copying Manuscripts: Before the printing press, scriptoria in monasteries were vital. Carthusians, valuing silence and solitude, were well-suited to the meticulous work of copying and illuminating manuscripts. This preserved knowledge and provided texts for their own library and potentially for exchange.
Writing: Some Carthusians became noted spiritual writers, theologians, or chroniclers, though this was an individual pursuit, not a primary ""activity"" of the whole house.
Strict Enclosure and Silence:

Carthusians lived under a very strict rule of enclosure, meaning they had minimal contact with the outside world.
Silence was observed for most of the day, with speaking allowed only at specific times or for necessary communication.
Limited Community Life:

Weekly Walk: Once a week, the monks would take a walk together outside the cloister (the spatiamentum), during which they were permitted to converse.
Communal Meal: Typically, they ate one main meal a day, alone in their cells, with food passed through a hatch. However, on Sundays and certain feast days, they might have a communal meal in the refectory.
Chapter Meetings: Regular meetings in the chapter house for community business, spiritual instruction from the Prior, and mutual correction.";FAUX

History
The commandry was definitely founded in the 12th century, and restored around 1540.[1]

The Château de Condat was the commandry for the Hospitallers who occupied the town from the 12th to the 18th centuries.[2] Known as Hospitalis de Condato and documented since 1239, it served the functions of fortification, tithe barn, residence, hostel for pilgrims and hospital for the sick.[3] It was the most important of the Hospitallers' commandries in Périgord.

During the Wars of Religion, the Huguenot leader, captain Pouch, transformed the church into a fortress that was besieged and taken by the seigneur of Losse.

Just as in the Wars of Religion, during the Fronde it changed hands several times.[4]

After the Storming of the Bastille in 1789, the commandry was pillaged.[1]";

La vie monastique s'y est maintenue du XIIe siècle à la Révolution française.

Histoire
L'abbaye a été fondée au XIIe siècle, sans doute à l'initiative de l'archevêque d'Auch Guillaume II d'Andozile de Montaut, du comte de Comminges et de l'évêque de Comminges[2], sur les rives du Touch. En 1207, le comte de Comminges Bernard IV donne la terre de Fabas à l'abbaye, qui accueille sa fille Mascarosa ou Mascarose. L'église abbatiale, dédiée à saint Bernard, de style gothique, est consacrée en 1231 par l'évêque de Comminges Grimoard Ier et l'archevêque d'Auch Amanieu Ier[3]. L'abbaye exerce certains droits seigneuriaux sur une partie des communes actuelles de Saint-André (Montdésert à la fin du Moyen-Âge), Lussan et Saint-Pé d'Arès (aujourd'hui Fabas). Fabas fonde les abbayes de l'Oraison-Dieu, à Muret, et en 1353, l'abbaye de l'Abondance-Dieu ou des Salenques, aux Bordes-sur-Arize (aujourd'hui dans l'Ariège).

Anglèze de Sagazan, la voyante de Notre-Dame-de-Garaison, y entre comme religieuse en 1543[4] et y meurt en 1589 ; elle dit continuer à y recevoir des apparitions, que le vicaire général du diocèse de Lombez juge réelles[5]. À l'époque moderne, le monastère accueille de nombreuses femmes issues des familles de la noblesse de Gascogne, du Comminges et du Languedoc[6] (de Benque, de Mun de Polastron, de Foix, d'Antin, de Terride, de Montant-Bénac[7]...).

L'abbaye est supprimée en 1790, pendant la Révolution française, en même temps que plusieurs autres abbayes et couvents de la région, dont l'abbaye de la Bénisson-Dieu de Boulogne-sur-Gesse[8] et l'abbaye de Bonnefont. Les bâtiments du monastère et ses métairies sont vendus comme bien national. Ils sont complètement détruits au cours des décennies qui suivent ; ne subsistent aujourd'hui que quelques éléments architecturaux, dont une clef de voûte en pierre avec sa rosace[9].

Les archives de l'abbaye sont conservées aux archives départementales de la Haute-Garonne[10].

Les armoiries de l'abbaye étaient « d'argent à une Vierge entourée de deux flambeaux d'azur, avec cette légende : Lumen Dei »[11]

It is now a museum. See:Â archimadrid.es/vidaconsagrada/conventos/santaclara/default.htm. 1. Foundation and Patronage:

Ancient Origins: The monastery is one of the oldest Clarisse foundations in Spain, traditionally dated to around 1255 or 1260. This places its founding very close to the death of St. Clare herself (1253) and during the initial expansion of the Order.
Noble/Royal Patronage: Like many significant early foundations, it likely benefited from noble, and possibly royal, patronage. This was common in Castile during the period of the Reconquista and the consolidation of Christian kingdoms. Such patronage would provide land, initial building funds, and ongoing support. Key figures associated with its early history often include members of the Castilian nobility. For instance, it has links to the lineage of Alfonso X of Castile.
Location on the Camino de Santiago:

Carrión de los Condes was a major stop on the French Way of the Camino de Santiago.
While the nuns were strictly enclosed, their monastery's presence in such a town meant:
They would be praying for the pilgrims who passed through.
They might receive alms from devout pilgrims.
The spiritual atmosphere of a pilgrimage town would permeate the area, reinforcing their own life of devotion.
Adherence to the Clarisse Rule:

Contemplative Prayer: This was the absolute heart of their existence. The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) chanted in choir, daily Mass (celebrated by a visiting Franciscan friar or other priest), and hours of mental prayer and meditation.
Radical Poverty: Despite any noble patronage for the foundation, the nuns themselves lived the ideal of poverty, owning nothing personally and relying on the community's resources, which were ideally meant to be simple and based on alms and their own labor.
Strict Enclosure (Cloister): They lived their lives entirely within the monastery walls. This separation from the world was considered essential for a life dedicated to contemplation. Communication with the outside was typically through a grille or a ""torno"" (a revolving hatch).
Community Life: Life was lived in common under the direction of an Abbess. This included shared meals (often in silence with spiritual reading), recreation, and chapter meetings.
Manual Labor: This was both a spiritual discipline and a means of contributing to the community's sustenance. In medieval Castile, this could include:
Spinning and Weaving: Castile was known for its wool. The nuns would produce fabric for their habits and other simple textiles.
Needlework and Embroidery: Creating and mending their own clothing, altar linens, and perhaps finer pieces if they had particular skills or received commissions that fit within their rule.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for vegetables, fruits, and medicinal herbs.
Baking: Making their own bread.
Architecture and Artistic Heritage:

The monastery complex, built over centuries, would reflect various architectural styles, primarily Gothic and later perhaps with Mudéjar influences (a style blending Christian and Islamic artistic traditions, common in medieval Spain).
Church: The church would be central, designed for the nuns' liturgical life, with a choir section for them, usually elevated or separated.
Cloister: Providing a space for prayer, procession, and access to the various rooms of the monastery (refectory, chapter house, cells, etc.).
Tombs: Important monasteries often became burial places for their founders, benefactors, and abbesses. Santa Clara de Carrión is noted for containing important tombs, including possibly those of early benefactors.
Museum/Art Collection: Over the centuries, such monasteries often accumulated significant religious art, liturgical objects, manuscripts, and textiles. The museum at Santa Clara de Carrión today houses many such treasures, including important medieval sculptures and artifacts.
Social Role and Significance:

Spiritual Center: For Carrión de los Condes and the surrounding region, the nuns were a powerhouse of prayer and intercession.
Noble Connections: The monastery often attracted daughters from local noble and hidalgo (lesser nobility) families, strengthening its ties to the regional elite.
Endurance: Its survival through centuries of Spanish history—through wars, political changes, and religious reforms—testifies to its deep roots and the enduring nature of the contemplative life.
In summary: The Clarisse nuns of Santa Clara de Carrión de los Condes in medieval times lived a rigorous life of prayer, poverty, and enclosure, deeply embedded in the Franciscan tradition. Their existence was shaped by their ancient foundation, noble patronage, and their location in a key town on the Camino de Santiago. They would have been a respected spiritual presence, contributing to the religious life of Castile through their hidden life of devotion and work. The rich artistic and historical heritage preserved there today gives us a tangible connection to their medieval past.";FAUX

The roof of the refectory was severely damaged and the prioress claimed she was unable to pay for the services of priests. Another visitation was made in 1389 by Archbishop Courtenay.

Ghazali;Early Nubian Christian ;;Saint Mary;680;1275;595;Ottoman rule;Sudan;SDN;Khartoum;15,6031;32,5265;Male;;;;personal research NY;;"The North Church in Ghazali with a basilical layout was mentioned already by 19th-century travelers and was first excavated by Peter Shinnie’s expedition.[4] It is a typical Makurian church.[1][2] The younger South Church is built entirely of mud bricks.[1]
One of the most intriguing and most captivating archaeological sites in Sudan is, surprisingly, not situated at the banks of the life-giving Nile. Instead, it is located in Wadi Abu Dom, at a distance of about 15 km from the river bank. When using modern technology we look down from the Earth’s orbit at this area, the beige snake of the wadi basks in the sun between the volcanic rocks of this part of the Bayuda desert. Yet, when we travel there, this snake glitters with the silver and golden flakes of mica. During the windy weather, even the visitors seem to be touched by the golden touch of Midas. This is the place where the Makurians built a monastery of the size of St. Catherine monastery in the Sinai. The place once visited by all of the famous travelers of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, like Richard Lepsius, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds, John Gardner Wilkinson, Pierre Trêmaux, or Ugo Monneret de Villard.

The Ghazali monastery is a site of the utmost importance not only for the studies on the history of Sudan, especially in the Makurian period but also for local economy as one of the best tourist destinations in the country. Peter Shinnie, Neville Chittick, and Sayed Nigm ed-Din Sherif, on behalf of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (then known as the Sudan Antiquities Service), started the excavation of the site in the 1950s. In two archaeological seasons, they cleared the church, refectories, and several other rooms.

The monastery also encompasses several other buildings that served different functions. A free-standing building contained at first six, and then twelve dormitories. The triple bedrooms were small, measuring about 20 square meters. Remains of a staircase indicate there was a second floor.[5] A refectory (dining room) and installations for food production, such as a mill and an oil press, were found as well.[1]
There is evidence suggesting the presence of a pilgrimage movement in Ghazali. Ghazali (locally Ghazālī; Arabic: ‏غزالي‎) is the best-preserved early-medieval Christian monastery in the Sudanese Bayuda Desert.  Although administratively it belongs to the modern “Merowe / Marawī” area (Northern State, SDN), the ruins sit 18 km west of the Nile in Wādī Abū Dom, an arid corridor once crossed by caravan and pilgrimage routes that linked the river to the Red Sea and to central Sudan.

────────────────────────
2. Chronological outline
────────────────────────
Phase I (c. AD 650-700) Foundation under the early kingdom of Makuria, shortly after Nubia’s conversion (c. 540-580).  
Phase II (c. 900-1000) Major enlargement: new mud-brick church, refectory remodelled, wells deepened.  
Phase III (c. 1050-1200/1250) Gradual decline but continuous use; little rebuilding.  
Phase IV (14th-15th c.) Transient Islamic re-occupation of a few rooms and creation of an adjacent Muslim cemetery.  Thereafter the site was abandoned and sand-covered.

Radiocarbon determinations, pottery series (“Early Christian Red Ware”, then “Classic Nubian Painted Ware”) and numismatic finds (two 11th-century Makurian copper coins) fit this sequence.

────────────────────────
3. General layout  (≈ 105 × 83 m inside the walls)
────────────────────────
A. Curtain wall  
• Sandstone footing, mud-brick superstructure 1.6 m thick; four gates (North Gate flanked by guard-rooms).  

B. Twin churches, south sector  
1 Older (northern) church  
  – 3-aisled stone basilica 26 × 14 m, single semicircular apse.  
  – Narthex with pairs of stair-towers leading to a flat timber roof (possible defensive or processional platform).  
  – Stone benches (subselli) along nave walls, marble chancel screen bases, sandstone reliquary under the altar.  

2 Younger (southern) church  
  – Entirely mud-brick, c. 950-1000.  
  – Shorter (18 × 11 m) but with a tri-apsidal east end (three conches beneath a single exterior wall).  
  – Plastered pilasters decorated with red-and-yellow geometric painting; a stepped synthronon survives in the central apse.  

C. Communal buildings (north-west)  
• Refectory: horseshoe-shaped stone dining bench (triclinium type) for c. 40 monks; flagstone floor with individual recessed foot-spaces.  
• Kitchen/bakery: four domed bread ovens (tannūr) and two grain-milling emplacements with rotary querns.  
• Cellar storerooms with amphora niches.

D. Domestic ranges (north curtain)  
Two-storey blocks of cubicle cells (3–3.5 m² each) with mud-plaster sleeping ledges; wooden stairs and corridors (sockets visible).  Latrine shaft with ceramic drain-pipes empties outside the wall.

E. Service quarter (east)  
• Stabling for pack-animals, a farriers’ hut (slag, tuyères, horse-shoe nails) and a bath-house consisting of a furnace room, warm apsidal chamber and cold room.  
• Two rock-cut, brick-lined wells 20–23 m deep; stone-paved channels led to cisterns and to a trough outside the east gate for caravans.

────────────────────────
4. Finds and cultural life
────────────────────────
Painted decoration  
Only fragments remained on walls fallen face-down into sand, but they include:  
• Bust of Christ Pantokrator with Greek inscription “IC XC”.  
• Mounted St George, Archangel Michael, Abbot(?) in white hooded cowl, Desert Fathers Anthony & Paul embracing.  
• Palette and style correspond to Faras and Banganarti workshops (ocher-yellow flesh, strong black outlines, broad haloes).

Epigraphy & language  
• Dipinti, ostraka and wooden tablets in Greek, Coptic and Old Nubian (minority in Sahidic).  
• Text types: liturgical headings (Psalm 140 etc.), building accounts (“paid to mason Georgios, 12 d.”), guest lists citing traders from Faras and churchmen from Dongola.  Personal names are predominantly Nubian but about 20 % are Greek/Christian Egyptian.

Portable artefacts  
• Bronze processional cross (33 cm), iron hand-bells, incense burner, stone oil-lamp stands.  
• A wooden book-cover engraved with a Maltese-type cross.  
• Hundreds of palm-leaf sandals, 260 spindle whorls—evidence of on-site textile production.  
• Ceramics: globular transport amphorae for wine/oil, painted tableware with cross-motifs, imported glazed splash-ware from Fustat (10th-11th c.).

Economy  
• The monastery controlled irrigated plots along temporary streams in Wādī Abū Dom: archaeobotany yielded barley, wheat, sorghum, grapes and date-palm.  
• Camel ribs, donkey teeth, goat/sheep bones dominate faunal assemblage; evidence for staging caravans and supplying travellers.  
• Textual and physical data suggest periodic royal subsidies from Makurian rulers in Dongola, paid in grain and textiles.

────────────────────────
5. Monastic identity
────────────────────────
No explicit charter survives, but architectural, liturgical and epigraphic parallels tie Ghazali to the Melkite-Coptic (Miaphysite) church of Nubia.  The community was cenobitic, headed by a hegoumenos or abbot; there is no sign of Benedictine or other Western rules.  The twin-church arrangement may reflect one space for the monks’ liturgy and another for lay pilgrims/caravaneers.

────────────────────────
6. End of occupation
────────────────────────
The clean abandonment horizons, lack of warfare layers, and near-total robbing of timber roofs indicate a managed withdrawal—probably as Makurian control collapsed in the 13th century and caravan traffic shifted.  Later Muslim wayfarers reused a handful of rooms; their small cemetery (11 east-facing graves) lies 120 m north-east of the south church.

────────────────────────
7. Visiting today
────────────────────────
• Road access: graded desert track from the Dongola-Atbara highway; 4×4 required.  
• On-site: conserved walls up to 2.5 m, information panels, shaded rest hut, fenced perimeter.

9. One-paragraph take-away
────────────────────────
Founded soon after Nubia’s Christianisation, Ghazali blossomed between the 7th and 11th centuries as a cenobitic monastery serving both monks and desert travellers.  Its twin churches, refectory with horseshoe dining bench, industrial zone and vast water system make it an unparalleled laboratory for early Nubian monastic life.  After a peaceful abandonment around 1200 AD and a brief Islamic after-life, the complex lay sealed by sand until modern excavations exposed its architecture, paintings and multilingual texts—now conserved and interpretable on site northwest of modern Merowe.";

The community was linked with the abbey of Westminster as well (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 223). The nucleus of the community formed around Kilburn, under the care of the abbey of Westminster, and was granted by Abbot Herbert (1121-c. 1136 at Godwyn's request to 3 maidens, Emma, Gunilda, and Christina, possibly handmaidens of Queen Matilda (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 25-6).

The account of the crown receiver, David ap Llewelyn ap John, for the first year after the dissolution of the house lists the tenents, rents and assets of the community. The community held tenants by lease and at will of [the vill of] Ehudan plus a water mill and fulling mill at Ehudan. It received rents of tenants at will and by deed in the vill of Llanllugan, in the lordship of Kodewe, which included tithes of wool, sheep, lambs and corn. The community also received rents from the tenants in the vill of Conway. It leased lands in Montgomery and received rent of diverse tithes from the rectory of Llanllugan. The rectory of Llanfair brought the community rent of tithes of corn and other profits. The nunnery also drew from the parish of Llanfair 140 bushels of oatmeal, valued at 7 pounds, according to the return in the Valor Ecclesiasticus. The income of the community was judged at 24 pounds, 4 shillings and 4 pence at dissolution. The community also had a grange at Ehudan near Castell Caereinion. In 1546 the property was ""particularised"" for a grant to Sir Arthur Darcy of the site of the abbey with 2 acres of meadow land, 1 clause of arable, the rectory of Llanllygan with its tithes, and 2 tenements with appurtenances for 4 pounds, 3 shillings and no pence. ; It was very small and poor; the community was only modestly endowed.";"4278 ; St. Mary's ; According to Madeleine Gray, the church of St. Mary's Llanllugan claims a Celtic foundation along with the neighbouring church of Llanwyddelan. Gwyddelan, alias Llorcan Wyddel, a disciple of St. Beuno and of Irish origin is regarded as the founder of both some time in the sixth century (Baring-Gould and Fisher 1911, 218-219, 378-380; Thomas 1908, 484-6). The two churches stood on an established thoroughfare, the Sarn Sws, of Roman origin, which linked the fort at Caersws to Chester. The community of nuns was established by Maredudd ap Rhobert probably between 1170-1190, according to Jane Cartwright. However, according to Gray, this charter refers to the 'holy nuns of Llanllugan' in a way that could be interpreted as implying that the community already existed. The charter may thus refer to the enforcement of Cistercian discipline on an already existing community. If the charter refers to a preexisting community, that community could have only had the most tenuous existence, since it was Maredudd's charter which gave the nuns their core estates in Llanllugan. Regardless, a Cistercian house was in existence at Llanllugan by the closing decade of the twelfth century. Llanllugan was placed under the jurisdiction of Strata Marcella. The present dedication to St. Mary the Virgin would be in harmony with the church's subsequent placement under Cistercian rule or influence. ; Although Knowles and Hadcock state the community was a priory, Cartwright and Williams state that it was actually an abbey, despite its small size and poor endowment. It was the only religious establishment for women in North Wales.

The rest came from spiritualities, income from the two churches of Llanfair Caereinion and Llanllwchaiarn, given to the community in the thirteenth century by the bishops of St. Asaph (Williams 1975, 162-3). In 1535 the community's net income was about 21 or 22 pounds per annum. ; Benedictine ; The community was always small, as indicated by the surviving church. In 1377 there were only 4 nuns and an abbess. At the time of suppression there were only 3 nuns (Williams 1975, 158). ; Powys ; (the lordship of) Cydewain; located a few miles from Newtown ; A little archaeological evidence survives for this site. This community also contains some of the best surviving medieval Cistercian stained glass; it is in perhaps one of the most important collections of Cistercian glass now extant. The community probably possessed glazed windows in the chapter room, refectory, and the superior's chamber, as well as in the church (Marks, 1988, 211). The remaining portions of the medieval stained glass bear the date of 1453. According to Gray, it is unlikely that there was ever a fully developed claustral complex. The community may have possessed only a single range adjacent to the north side of the church, where an early blocked doorway and wall-footings would indicate some ancilliary structure. The nuns' buildings could easily underlie the present farm and would be difficult to distinguish from a substantial farm complex, perhaps supporting the conclusions of Gilchrist inÂ Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women. It is also possible that this house had a north cloister. ; This community possessed some of the iconographically richest, most important Cistercian stained glass. The central image of the original scheme is a depiction of the crucifixion, which depicts a scatter of bones at the base of the cross, including a crude, pre-Vesalian skull (still extant). The primitive representation of the skull in this depiction (and others) of the crucifixion seems to date the window artistically to the fifteenth century. The glass also depicts a jawbone of an ass which would have stood originally in close association with the figure of the crucified Jesus; this image would have provided a subtle reference to the resurrection and triumph of life and love (see Gray). The figure of Jesus is shown at the moment of death, naked but for a waistcloth, hands clenched, wearing the crown of throns. There are now no accompanying figures, but in the original arrangement the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist would have been depicted. A figure of John does survive, now placed incorrectly in one of the small upper lights. The apostle is shown as a beardless young man, holding the palm given him by the Virgin Mary to carry before her coffin at her funeral and bearing a chalice from which a serpent or snake emerges (Gray). Two angels also exist, beautifully delineated. The final complete figure of the scheme is perhaps the best known: the kneeling nun. The Llanllugan nun is a very important figure, painstakingly painted in great detail, her mantle and habit very carefully and skilfully delineated (despite the fact that Mostyn Lewis commented that she had a big nose!). She is shown kneeling and in an attitude of prayer, but she is not the donor of the glass. The most likely explanation is that it is a depiction of the convent superior in office at the time that the glass was put in place; representations of the donors, Richard and Cecily of York may have existed but are now not extant (Gray). A fragment of the representation of John the Baptist also exists. A beam now built into the chimney-stack at a nearby house, Gwernfydau, is also believed to have belonged to the convent. The beam is carved from left to right with two quatrefoils with foliated terminations to their cuspings; a dove; a stag chased by a hound; a double-headed 'dragonesque beast'; and a crucifix. At the end of the beam there are indications of an inscription (Gray). ; Glamorgan Archives CL Deeds 1/3250 contains a charter recording a grant made by Maredudd ap Rhobert, lord of Cydewain. This charter is the only extant example relating to Llanllugan nunnery. The Mostyn Owned deeds, Shropshire Record Office 3651/MO VII include deeds relating to Llanllugan and the district dating to the century following the Dissolution. In 1188 Enoch, abbot of Ystrad Marchell, reportedly eloped with a nun from the Cistercian house of Llansanffraid-yn-Elfael (probably Llanllugan). ; Maredudd ap Rhobert, lord of Cydewain, granted the nunnery the whole vill of Llanllugan, Talhalun, and other lands circa 1216-17. The nunnery seems to have acquired its other lands from lords of Powys Wenwynwyn or their tenants. In the fifteenth century the convent had a wealthy and generous patron in Richard, Duke of York, father of the future Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III and a Garter knight. Richard is the likely patron for the stained glass of the community, which bears the date of 1453 and the inscription ""Orate pro bono...qui fecit fabrica..."" The wording seems to indicate that the donor (likely Richard) was still alive at the time of the glass's creation. ; What remains of the medieval stained glass possessed by this community is now all gathered together in the east window of the parish church, above the altar. ; Llanllugan was placed under the jurisdiction of Strata Marcella. ; [1]A foundation charter.";FAUX

While not as universally famous as places like Clonmacnoise or Glendalough, its name is typical of early foundations, and there are historical mentions that connect such a place name to early Christian activity.

For example, the Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii (Tripartite Life of St. Patrick) mentions Patrick founding churches at places with ""Eanach"" in their name, sometimes leaving some of his followers there. If Enach Árd was one such foundation, it would date back to the 5th or 6th century.

The activities at Enach Árd, like other early Irish monastic settlements, would have revolved around a communal life dedicated to prayer, work, study, and service.

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei - ""Work of God""):

Divine Office: The central rhythm of the day. The community (whether monks, nuns, or a mixed community initially) would gather at set times to recite or chant the Psalms, hymns, and prayers.
Mass (Eucharist): Celebrated in their oratory or small church (likely wooden in the earliest period, possibly later replaced by a simple stone structure).
Private Prayer and Asceticism: Individual prayer, meditation, fasting, vigils, and other penitential practices were integral to the spirituality of early Irish monks and nuns.
Manual Labor (Self-Sufficiency and Spiritual Discipline):

Agriculture: Cultivating land to grow crops like oats, barley, and vegetables. Raising livestock such as cattle, sheep, and pigs would be essential for food and materials (wool, hides).
Resource Gathering from the ""Enach"" (Marsh):
Reeds and rushes for thatching roofs, making baskets, and floor coverings.
Wildfowl for food.
Possibly fishing if the marsh was connected to waterways.
Peat for fuel (if in a boggy area).
Crafts:
Textile Production: If nuns were present, spinning wool and flax, weaving cloth for habits, blankets.
Woodworking: For building, making simple furniture, tools.
Leatherworking: For shoes, satchels, book covers.
Possibly basic metalworking for tools.
Building and Maintenance: Constructing and maintaining their individual cells (often simple round or rectangular huts of wattle-and-daub or dry stone), the church, guest houses, workshops, and the surrounding enclosure (typically an earthen bank or wooden palisade known as a ráth or lios).
Learning, Scholarship, and Artistic Expression:

Scriptural Study: The Bible, especially the Psalms and Gospels, would be the primary focus of study and memorization.
Manuscript Copying (Scribal Work): Even smaller monasteries would strive to have copies of essential texts. They might copy scriptures, psalters, commentaries, or lives of saints.
Oral Tradition: Reciting genealogies, poetry, stories of saints, and local history.
Artistic Work (Potentially): While less likely to be a major center like Kells, there might have been simple stone carving (e.g., cross-inscribed slabs) or decoration of wooden objects.
Community Life:

Rule of Life: Following a rule, which in early Ireland was often based on the teachings and example of the founding saint (if known) or a prominent monastic figure like St. Columba or St. Comgall. This would emphasize obedience, humility, prayer, and work.
Guidance by an Abbot/Abbess: The head of the monastery provided spiritual leadership and managed the community's affairs.
Training Novices: Educating and forming new members in the monastic way of life.
Interaction with the Laity (the Local Tuath or Territory):

Hospitality (Féilire): Providing food, shelter, and care to travelers, pilgrims, the poor, and those seeking refuge was a cornerstone of Irish monasticism.
Pastoral Care: Offering spiritual guidance, baptism, confession, and other sacraments to the local population.
Education: Sometimes providing basic education for children from local families, especially those of patrons.
The monastery would have served as a spiritual, social, and often economic focal point for the surrounding area.";FAUX

Run according to the Augustinian rule, it was the residence of the Hospitallers' Grand Prior in England, and was thus their English headquarters. Its great landholding – until Protestant monarch Edward VI of England – was in the ancient parish of Marylebone, in the now Inner London area known as St John's Wood, which it had farmed out on agricultural tenancies as a source of produce and income.[1]

History
Foundation
Jordan Briset, a Norman baron, founded the Priory in the reign of Henry II (along with a Benedictine nunnery alongside), and its church was consecrated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Heraclius, in 1185. Henry held an aulic council at the Priory, at which Heraclius convinced the king that he should send English troops to a new crusade but was unable to persuade the barons to allow Henry to lead them personally (even when Henry was offered the crown of Jerusalem in return, and even after Heraclius shouted in a rage ""Here is my head, here is my head; treat me, if you like, as you did my brother Thomas. It is a matter of indifference to me whether I die by your orders or in Syria by the hands of the infidels; for you are worse than a Saracen."") Thomas Malory was one of those later buried in this church.

Medieval heyday
Matthew Paris recounts a party of Hospitallers setting out from the Priory in 1237 for Crusade thus:

the Hospitallers sent their prior, Theodoric, a German by birth, and a most clever knight, with a body of other knights and stipendiary attendants, and a large sum of money, to the assistance of the Holy Land. They having made all arrangements, set out from their house at Clerkenwell, and proceeded in good order, with about thirty shields uncovered, with spears raised, and preceded by their banner, through the midst of the City, towards the bridge, that they might obtain the blessings of the spectators, and, bowing their heads with their cowls lowered, commended themselves to the prayers of all.

This was the only Hospitaller priory in England not to be able to pay its own way, due to its having to support and entertain the Grand Prior and large number of pensioners and guests from the court – in 1337 alone it spent more than its entire revenue (its whole revenue was at least £8,000). Royal guests at the Priory included King John in 1212,[2] Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward I) and his wife Eleanor of Castile in 1265.,[3] Henry IV in 1399[4] and Henry V in 1413.[5]

Fire and reconstruction

18th-century view of the South Gate (now known as St John's Gate)

Alternative view of the South Gate
Though additions were made to the complex in Edward I's reign, the mob of the Peasants' Revolt burned it down. Nevertheless, a royal council was held there in 1485, at which Richard III publicly decided against his earlier plan to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York.

It was only fully rebuilt by 1504, the date of completion for the grand south gate erected by Sir Thomas Docwra (the penultimate Grand Prior, also buried in the Priory church). William Camden wrote that the rebuilt complex resembled a palace, and had in it a very fair church, and a tower-steeple raised to a great height, with so fine workmanship that it was a singular beauty and ornament to the city.

Dissolution
In 1502 Henry VII of England was chosen Protector of the Hospitallers, but he did not provide them the men and money (for their defence of Rhodes against Suleyman the Magnificent) that he had promised. After the island finally fell the Order's Grand Master, L'Isle Adam, was received by Henry's son Henry VIII. At his request, Henry confirmed the privileges of the knights, though he later dissolved Clerkenwell and the rest of the order as part of his wider Dissolution since they ""maliciously and traitorously upheld the 'Bishop of Rome' to be Supreme Head of Christ's Church"" and thus intended to subvert ""the good and godly laws and statues of this realm."" The king granted the last prior, William Weston, and the order's other officers small annuities, and so they did not oppose their house's dissolution, and most of the Knights retired to their stronghold of Malta, though three who did not were executed by Henry as traitors (one hung and quartered, the others beheaded). Henry granted the Priory church to John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland for £1,000, and used it and the rest of the complex to store his hunting-nets. In 1540 ten newly made serjeants-at-law hosted a great banquet at St John's for London's mayor and aldermen and for all the Lords and Commons, at which rings were handed out to the guests, and, according to Stow, at another of these feasts in 1531, thirty-four great beeves were consumed, besides thirty-seven dozen pigeons and fourteen dozen swans.

Edward VI to James I
Henry's son Edward granted the Priory's remaining lands to other noblemen. John Stow reports that, in the third year of Edward's reign, ""the [Priory] church for the most part, to wit, the body and side aisles, with the great bell-tower (a most curious piece of workmanship, graven, gilt, and inameled, to the great beautifying of the city, and passing all other that I have seen), was under mined and blown up with gunpowder; the stone thereof was employed in building of the Lord Protector's house in the Strand."" Other stone from the Priory was used to construct the porch of the church of All Hallows Lombard Street (corner of Gracechurch Street, demolished 1937), and by Fuller's time the choir of the Priory church was in ""a pitiful plight"".

Mary I (who had often stayed at the priory buildings during Edward's reign, making extravagant progresses with Catholic nobles from there to her brother's court at Whitehall Palace) revived the order and restored its possessions, whilst her Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Pole, built a new west front on the Priory church and made repairs to its side chapels. The church was sufficiently restored for the Merchant Taylors Guild to celebrate mass there, during which offerings were made and the choir was hung with tapestries. However, the order was once again sent back to Malta on the accession of Elizabeth. During her reign her Master of the Revels, Edmund Tylney, stayed in the Priory buildings, as did all his tailors, embroiderers, painters, carpenters, and the stage crews for court plays and masques – the great hall of the complex was used for rehearsals. James I of England granted the buildings to Lord Aubigny (removing the Revels Office to St Peter's Hill), and it later passed to Sir William Cecil then to the Earl of Elgin.

17th century
In 1623 Joseph Hall, later Bishop of Exeter and Norwich, reopened the repaired choir and, in Charles I's reign, the Earl of Elgin turned the church into the Aylesbury Chapel, as his private chapel.

It later became a Presbyterian meeting-house, remaining so until 1710. Its pews were ripped out by the Sacheverell rioters to burn outside the nearby house of Bishop Gilbert Burnet. The chapel was enlarged in 1721, and in 1723 was bought for £3,000 by the commissioners for building fifty new churches to become the parish church of St John Clerkenwell.

Clerkenwell Priory of the Order of Saint John, in January 2020
In 1878 one of the large painted windows from the old church still survived at the parish church's east end, as did remains of Prior Docwra's church in the south and east walls, and capitals and rib mouldings of the former church underpinned the pews. All that remains of the complex now is Docwra's south gate, largely reconstructed in Victorian times and now known as St John's Gate, in St John's Square, and an Early English crypt remaining beneath the neighbouring parish church of St John Clerkenwell. The priory arch stone found its way to Exmouth in Devon where it was incorporated into the structure of the local branch of the St John Ambulance Brigade ";

However, the visitation did not confirm these accusations. Lincoln Episcopal Registers, Memo. Sutton, 173. In 1300, Bishop Dalderby performed another visitation in order to explain De Claustura Monialium. While the majority of nuns seemed ameniable to the statute, as the Bishop left 4 nuns followed him to the gate claiming that they would not heed the statute.

Mary of Sopwell, Sopewell, S. Albans ; Elkins,Â Holy Women of Twelfth-Century England., establishes the foundation date as 1140 when nuns from S. Albans form the comunity. It began to grow shortly thereafter. Nuns resided here supported by alms and attended to the poor. Sopwell was founded on the site of an antique hermitage. S. Thompson believes that Geoffrey, abbot of S. Albans is the probable founder (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 229). S. Foot notes that there may have been a community of religious women loosely associated with the abbey for some time before the official 1140 foundation. Two abbots, Wulfnoth during the reign of Edgar, and Paul, after the Conquest, made attempts to regularize the women attached to St. Albans(Veiled Women, vol. 2, 157-158). According to Dugdale, the abbot of St. Albans, Vulsig, first attached the nuns to the male community. His successor, Wlnoth, moved the nuns away from the male monastery to their own community and set up a strict rule from them. It is not clear from Dugdale whether this new community, which was set up before the Danes overran St. Alban's in 930, was Sopwell (Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 2, 180). Matthew Paris seems to be Dugdale's main source. He does have a seperate entry for Sopwell that agrees with Elkins and Thompson (Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 3, 362-363). ; In 1163, the abbey of S. Albans tried to extend its jurisdiction over the nuns. ; BOSB--Benedictine Order ; Manuscripts from St. Albans Abbey, 1066-1235 ; Medieval Religious Houses in England and Wales, 219; ; Gesta abbatum monasterii Sancti Albani, vol. 1, 80-2. ; Two holy women living at Eywood in 1140 moved Abbot Geoffrey to establish a regular community of nuns at Sopwell. During the time when Lady Margaret Wynter was at the monastery there were a number of high ranking visitors including: Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (son of Henry IV) in 1427; Henry, Cardinal Beaufort in 1428; and Margaret Beaufort, the Duchess of Clarence, in 1429. Eleanor Hulle, a benefactor of St. Alban's, was rumored to have stayed at the priory which led to an attack by the famous thief William Wawe and his men. They were unable to find Eleanor Hulle and subsequently attempted to plunder the priory but the nuns and their property were saved by the intervention of some townsmen. ; Agnes Wakefield is named in a lease of the community's property to Agnes Gascoyne. Juliana Berners, presumed author of the ""Boke of st. Albans"" was thought to have been a prioress at Sopwell in the 15th century. Unfortunately, this cannot be verified due to a gap in the records of the priory ranging roughly from 1430-1480. Joan Pygot was the last prioress of Sopwell (Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 3, 363). ; In 1535 the net income of the community was valued at over 40 pounds. ; Benedictine ; Many of the nuns came from well-off families as evidenced by the incidents of benefaction by the nuns themselves. The powerful social connections of the nuns was utilized time and again by prioresses like Elizabeth Webbe who was put in place, and later deposed by, Abbot William Wallingford. Elizabeth was able to take her case to the Court of the Arches and was eventually reinstated. Elizabeth's success was tempered by the Abbot who sent two monks from S. Albans to beat her and have her imprisoned. Elizabeth seems to have leveled a number of charges against Abbot Wallingford and is believed to have been one of the sources for Cardinal John Morton's accounting of the Abbot, whom he investigated on the orders of Pope Innocent VIII (though he may not have made a formal visitation). ; Circa 1330 there were 19 nuns; at about the time of suppression there were 9 nuns, but when the priory was suppressed in 1537 there were only 5 nuns (Medieval Religious Houses in England and Wales, 219). ; Sopwell ; From 940 to 1140 it may have been attached to the Benedictine male monastery of S. Albans. Traditionally, it was thought to have been founded in 793. After 1140 the convent was located a half a mile east of St. Alban's (Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 3, 364). ; There was a visitation performed by Abbot Michael in 1338. He issues a number of injunctions including: the nuns were required to sing the mass of St. Alban once a week, no nun was to leave the dormitory before the bell had been rung or without permission, upon waking the nuns must attend a mass of our Lady and then occupy themselves with private devotions until Prime, which all but the sick were required to attend, ect. The injunctions went on to detail almost every aspect of the nuns daily routine, and they seem to be precautionary rather than a reaction to the actual behavior of the nuns. ; Sopwell Priory Excavations 1962-66 ; Two twelfth-century voussoir stones from Sopwell House, St. Albans. ; Juliana Barnes, a fifteenth century prioress of Sopwell, is supposed to have written ""The Book Containing the Treatises of Hawking, Hunting, Coat Armour, Fishing and Blasing of Arms"" also known as the ""Boke of St. Albans.""(Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 3, 363). ; Abbot Geoffrey of St. Albans, Henry de Albini and sons, Roland de Dinan, Richard de Tany, and Henry III.

Delapré Abbey was one of only two Cluniac nunneries in England (the other being Arthington Priory). So, this was a house for Cluniac nuns.

Here's what life and activities would have been like for the Cluniac nuns at Delapré Abbey during medieval times:

Foundation and Patronage:

Founded around c. 1145 by Simon II de Senlis, Earl of Northampton. Noble patronage was typical for such foundations.
It was an abbey, indicating it was headed by an Abbess and was a relatively substantial foundation.
Cluniac Order (for Nuns):

Benedictine Roots: The Cluniac order was a reform of the Benedictine order. Nuns would follow the Rule of St. Benedict, adapted for women and with Cluniac customs.
Emphasis on Liturgy: A hallmark of the Cluniac tradition was a very elaborate and solemn celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office). This would have been the central focus of the nuns' day and night, involving much chanting in their abbey church. Daily Mass was also paramount.
Enclosure: As nuns, they would have lived a strictly enclosed life within the abbey precincts, with limited contact with the outside world.
Property and Wealth: Cluniac houses were often well-endowed with lands and properties. Delapré Abbey was reasonably wealthy. This meant:
They would derive income from their estates (rents from tenants, agricultural produce).
Lay brothers or paid servants likely managed much of the external agricultural work on their lands.
Activities of the Nuns within the Enclosure:

Prayer and Liturgy (as above): Their primary ""work.""
Manual Labor (adapted): While extensive agricultural labor was less likely for enclosed nuns with estates, they would still engage in manual work within the cloister:
Textile Work: Spinning wool or flax, weaving cloth.
Fine Needlework and Embroidery: This was a common and highly valued skill in nunneries. They would produce altar cloths, liturgical vestments, and other fine textiles. English embroidery (Opus Anglicanum) was famous in the medieval period, and nunneries often contributed.
Gardening: Cultivating a cloister garden for herbs (medicinal and culinary), some vegetables, and flowers for the altar.
Manuscript Work (possible, but less central than for monks): Copying devotional texts or choir books. Some nunneries had scriptoria.
Making candles, simple medicines from their herb garden.
General upkeep of their living quarters and parts of the abbey.
Community Life: Living together under an Abbess, sharing meals (often in silence with spiritual reading), and participating in chapter meetings.
Hospitality (limited): While hospitality was a Benedictine virtue, for enclosed nuns, this would be managed carefully, perhaps with a guesthouse outside the main enclosure for certain visitors, or through alms given at the gate.
Social Composition:

Nunneries like Delapré often attracted daughters from noble and gentry families.
Notable Historical Connection:

The Battle of Northampton (1460), part of the Wars of the Roses, was fought in the meadows near Delapré Abbey. King Henry VI was captured at this battle and reportedly spent the night at Delapré Abbey before being taken to London.
Dissolution of the Monasteries:

As with all monastic houses in England, Delapré Abbey was dissolved by King Henry VIII during the Reformation. It was surrendered to the Crown in 1538.
The nuns were pensioned off, and the abbey's lands and properties were confiscated and eventually sold or granted to laypeople. The buildings were later converted into a private residence.
In summary, the Cluniac nuns of Delapré Abbey in medieval England lived a life centered on elaborate liturgical prayer within a strict enclosure. They were supported by significant landed endowments and engaged in manual labor appropriate to their status and enclosed life, such as fine needlework. The abbey was a notable religious institution for women, with strong noble connections, until its suppression in the 16th century.

The main building of Delapré Abbey still stands today and is open to the public, preserving much of its historic fabric.";FAUX

Here's what you should know about it:

The Gilbertine Order:

This was the only purely English monastic order, founded by St. Gilbert of Sempringham in Lincolnshire in the 12th century (around 1130).
Its most distinctive feature was that most of its houses were ""double monasteries,"" meaning they accommodated both men (canons regular following the Augustinian rule) and women (nuns, often following a Cistercian-influenced rule).
There were also lay brothers (conversi) and lay sisters (conversae) who performed manual labor.
The sexes lived in strictly separate enclosures, usually sharing a church that was divided to maintain separation, but coming together (in a carefully managed way) for certain liturgical functions. The canons were primarily responsible for the spiritual welfare and sacramental needs of the nuns.
Alvingham Priory - Foundation and History:

Founded: Around 1154-1155. The foundation was initiated by a local lord, possibly Hugh de Scotney or Hamon, son of Geoffrey de Louth, with St. Gilbert himself involved in its establishment.
Location: In Alvingham, Lincolnshire, near Louth. Lincolnshire was the heartland of the Gilbertine order.
Nature: It was a typical Gilbertine ""double house"" with communities of both canons and nuns.
Economy: Like many monasteries, it would have relied on agriculture, sheep farming (Lincolnshire was famous for wool), fishing (from local waters/ponds), and donations/endowments from patrons.
Importance: Alvingham was one of the larger and more important Gilbertine houses.
The Dissolution of the Monasteries:

Like all monastic houses in England, Alvingham Priory was suppressed during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries.
It was surrendered to the Crown in September 1538.
At the time of its surrender, there were reportedly the prior, 8 canons, 10 lay brothers, and 19 nuns.
The lands and properties were confiscated by the Crown and subsequently sold or granted to laypeople.
What Remains Today:

The most significant survival is the Church of St. Adelwold, which now serves as the parish church of Alvingham. This church was originally part of the priory complex, likely serving as the canons' church or a section of the main priory church that was retained for parochial use after the Dissolution. It contains medieval elements.
There are earthworks and buried archaeological remains of the wider priory complex in the surrounding fields. These indicate the layout of the claustral buildings for both the canons and the nuns, fishponds, and other associated structures.
The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, recognizing its historical and archaeological importance.
Some stonework from the priory may have been reused in local farm buildings and houses over the centuries.
In summary, Alvingham Priory was a notable establishment of the unique English Gilbertine order, functioning as a double monastery for canons and nuns for about 400 years until its suppression in the 16th century. Its legacy is primarily preserved through the parish church and the archaeological remains of the site.";FAUX

St James at Arundel was not a great abbey but a small medieval hospital-priory that combined charitable work (chiefly for lepers and the poor) with a modest religious life.  Medieval documents variously call it domus, hospitale, Maison-Dieu, or even monasterium Sancti Jacobi de Arundell, so later antiquaries occasionally labelled it a ‘monastery of St James’.  Below is a compact dossier.

1. Name, location, patron saint
• Usual medieval title: Hospital (or Maison-Dieu) of St James of Arundel; a few 14th-c. deeds add “and St John”.  
• Dedication: St James the Greater – the apostle traditionally invoked for lepers and pilgrims.  
• Site: just outside the east gate of Arundel, West Sussex, beside the causeway across the Arun water-meadows (approx. National Grid TQ 019 071).  Nothing now stands above ground; the spot is occupied by modern housing east of Arsenal Road.

2. Foundation and early history
• Probably between c. 1140 and 1160, almost certainly by William d’Aubigny I or II, the first Norman earls of Arundel.  
• The oldest surviving reference (gift of firewood from Arundel forest) is a charter of William d’Aubigny III, datable 1176 × 1193.  
• First explicitly called a leper hospital in a Pipe-Roll entry of 1208.

• Governed by a “master” (magister) and a handful of brethren; papal and episcopal letters tell them to observe the Rule of St Augustine, as was normal for English hospitals.  
• Sex of the inmates: sources speak of “brothers” (fratres) only; no separate women’s range is ever mentioned, so the house is best treated as male.  
• Liturgical obligations: daily Mass in the chapel and an abbreviated Divine Office for the master and healthy brethren; leper inmates were expected to attend through a hagioscope from an adjoining room.

4. Physical layout (reconstructed from 16th-c. leases & 1973 watching brief)
1. Chapel oriented E–W (stone walls 1 m thick, ca 19 × 7 m).  
2. Leper hall on the north, separated by a screen wall with squint into the chancel.  
3. Cloister-like court to the south with timber dormitory, refectory, kitchen and a small garden.  
4. Two fishponds fed by a side channel of the River Arun; a paddock and orchard completed the precinct of roughly 2 acres.

5. Endowments and economy
• Original estate: c. 60 acres of arable & meadow in Arundel and Tortington; pasture for 8 cows; a toll-free boat to ferry firewood across the Arun.  
• 1291 Taxatio value: £3 15 s 4 d (very modest).  
• Valor Ecclesiasticus 1535: gross £10 8 s 4 d, net £8 13 s 6 d.  Rents from town plots had by then replaced most agricultural income.  
• Occasional alms from the Earls of Arundel and local gilds paid for bread, fish and a dish of meat on St James’s day (25 July) to both inmates and poor townsfolk.

6. Late medieval condition and suppression
• Visitation of Bishop William Rede, 1357: four lepers, two serving brothers, buildings “sufficient but in need of roof lead”.  
• By 1526 only two inmates remained; Wolsey’s commissioners proposed amalgamating it with the newly founded Cardinal College at Oxford, but the plan lapsed.  
• Supressed under the Act for the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries, 1536.  
• Site and lands were granted in 1544 to Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel; the buildings became a tenant farm and were gradually dismantled.  A last fragment of chapel wall was still noted by the antiquary James Dallaway in 1815; gone by 1850.

7. Surviving evidence
• Structural: nothing above ground; a 1973 pipe-trench exposed mortared flint footings and a rubble floor that match the chapel dimensions given in a 1609 lease.  
• Loose finds: a Purbeck-marble grave slab (13th-c. cross-head) is preserved in Arundel Museum; two 15th-c. encaustic tiles, now in Worthing Museum, probably came from the chapel floor.  
• Archives:

8. Order and gender in a sentence
St James’s, Arundel, was a tiny male hospital-priory following the Augustinian rule; it was dedicated to the apostle James and never contained nuns.

In April of 1308, Archbishop Corbridge appointed Emma de Ebor to the position of prioress. (York Archiepis. Reg.

It was reorganized in 1316 when impoverished nuns went elsewhere temporarily for sustenance. The probable founder of Wintney is Geoffrey fitz Peter (Thompson, 230).

However in 1315 Bishop Woodlock came again and issued a set of injunctions which pertained to a stricter observance of the nuns rule. A year later the archbishop of Canterbury sent a letter to Bishop Woodlock detailing the various problems that had been observed at the nunnery including the nuns being ""dispersed"" into the secular world because they did not have enough food provisions. Bishop Woodlock died before he was able to correct these abuses and the archbishop of Canterbury was so concerned that he arranged for corrections himself. This sad state of affairs might have been cuased by the famine that afflicted England in 1315. Later on the nuns seem to have be doing better financially. In 1501 the nunnery was again visited by Dr. Hede, a commissionary of the prior of Canterbury, finding that the annual income was Â£50 and that the house was 20 marks in debt, 15 of which had already been paid. ; No physical remains exist at the site and no documents are extant which tell of the convent's architectural features. ; The obituary list for the priory of Wintney lists 3 different people, all of whom lived at different times, as fundator. The first, Geoffrey fitz Peter, lived in the second half of the 12th century, and was probably the original founder in the sense that he granted the site and some of the initial endowments.

Phase 1: Early Monastery (c. 640 – c. 870) – Northumbrian/Celtic (Columban Influence)

This is the period most directly connected to the ""Columban"" tradition, though it's more accurately described as part of the Northumbrian monastic tradition, which was heavily influenced by Irish (Columban) missionaries from Iona and Lindisfarne.

Foundation and Early Figures:

Traditionally founded around 640 AD by St. Æbbe the Elder, who was a Northumbrian princess (sister of Kings Oswald and Oswiu of Northumbria). She became its first abbess.
It was a double monastery, housing both monks and nuns in separate communities but under the rule of an abbess (a common feature in Celtic/Northumbrian monasticism).
St. Cuthbert is said to have visited Coldingham and even spent nights in prayer by the sea there.
St. Æthelthryth (Etheldreda), later foundress of Ely, spent time as a nun at Coldingham before Æbbe's death (c. 683).
Columban/Northumbrian Characteristics and Activities:

Austerity: Life would have been characterized by simplicity, fasting, and penance, typical of the Irish monastic tradition.
Prayer and Liturgy: The primary focus. The Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours) would have been recited or chanted. Celebration of Mass.
Manual Labor: Essential.
Monks: Farming (cultivating crops, tending livestock), fishing (given its coastal location), building, various crafts.
Nuns: Textile work (spinning, weaving, embroidery – Anglo-Saxon nuns were renowned for this), gardening, care of the sick, food preparation.
Learning and Scholarship: Irish monasticism valued learning. While perhaps not on the scale of Iona or Lindisfarne, there would have been study of scriptures, classical texts (if available), and possibly some manuscript copying.
Pastoral Care/Mission: Monks might have engaged in preaching and ministering to the local population in the surrounding area.
Architecture: Likely wooden buildings initially, in the style of early Irish and Anglo-Saxon monastic sites.
Decline and Destruction:

The monastery experienced periods of moral decline (Bede mentions this).
It was reportedly destroyed by Danish Vikings around 870 AD during their major invasions, and lay desolate for over two centuries.
Phase 2: Benedictine Priory (c. 1098 – Reformation)

This is a distinct later phase, where the monastic tradition changed.

Refoundation:

Refounded around 1098 by King Edgar of Scotland.
It was established as a Benedictine priory and became a cell (dependent house) of Durham Cathedral Priory in England. This brought it firmly into the mainstream of Anglo-Norman Benedictine monasticism, rather than the earlier Celtic/Columban tradition.
Benedictine Life and Activities:

Rule of St. Benedict: Life was governed by this rule, emphasizing ""Ora et Labora"" (Prayer and Work).
Liturgy (Opus Dei): The solemn chanting of the Divine Office in the priory church was the central activity. Daily Mass.
Property and Estate Management: Coldingham became a very wealthy priory, owning vast lands (the ""Coldinghamshire""). The monks (or their lay officials) would have been heavily involved in managing these estates, collecting rents, and overseeing agricultural production.
Manual Labor (by monks): Less emphasis on individual monks doing heavy agricultural labor compared to the early period or Cistercian houses. Much of the estate work was done by lay brothers (if any) or tenants. Monks within the cloister might engage in gardening, crafts, or administrative tasks.
Scholarship and Scriptorium: As a cell of Durham (a major center of learning), there would have been some level of scholarly activity and possibly manuscript copying.
Hospitality: Providing for travelers and pilgrims, as was Benedictine custom.
Architecture: Substantial stone buildings were erected, including a large priory church (parts of which remain today), cloister, and other monastic buildings, in Romanesque and later Gothic styles.
Political Importance: Due to its wealth, its strategic location in the Borders, and its connection to Durham, Coldingham Priory was often involved in the political and ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland and Anglo-Scottish relations.
Dissolution:

The priory suffered during the Anglo-Scottish wars.
It was effectively suppressed during the Scottish Reformation in 1560, though monks may have remained for some time. Its lands were secularized.
In Summary for ""Columban in Medieval Times"":
The ""Columban"" aspect of Coldingham is primarily associated with its early medieval phase (7th-9th centuries). During this time, it was deeply influenced by the Irish monastic traditions brought to Northumbria, characterized by its double monastery structure, austerity, and specific spiritual practices.

After its refoundation in the late 11th century, it became a Benedictine house, following a different monastic rule and customs, though the memory of its early saints and sanctity would have remained. So, while its origins were in the Columban sphere, for the majority of the High and Late Medieval periods, Coldingham was a Benedictine priory.";FAUX

Premonstratensian “house” of Guyzance (often written Guizance, Gysnes, Wiyzance, Wyshance) – Northumberland, England

Status
• Never an independent abbey or priory in its own right.  
• It was a tiny cell / grange belonging to Alnwick Abbey (the great Premonstratensian house founded 1147 by Eustace fitz-John a few miles to the north-west).  
• In charters it is usually styled simply domus / mansio / grangia canonicorum de Alnewic apud Guizance.

Foundation
• c. 1180-1200.  The land at Guyzance on the south bank of the River Coquet was granted to the Alnwick canons by one of the local baronial families (almost certainly the de Vescy or de Percy line).  
• The purpose was two-fold:
 1. a pastoral out-station – two canons served the small river-side chapel for the scattered population;  
 2. an economic grange – the fertile haughs, water-mill site and salmon fishery provided grain, hay and fish for the mother-house.

Personnel
• Never more than 2–3 white canons resident at any time; most medieval episcopal visitation lists mention only “one canon and a lay servant”.  
• They were nominated by, and answerable to, the abbot of Alnwick; no separate prior is recorded.

Property & Income
• Arable strips and meadows between the hamlet of Guyzance and Brainshaugh.  
• A water-mill on the Coquet (later the site of the 18th-century iron- and paper-mills).  
• A several salmon fishery and the right to erect a yair (weir).  
• Small rents from ten cottars recorded in 1296 lay subsidy.  
• Everything was accounted for in the Alnwick compotus under “Gysnes Grangia”.

Buildings
• A rectangular cloister-like court, timber at first, rebuilt in stone 14th c.; a modest chapel (dedicated to St Wilfrid in a 1405 charter).  
• Nothing stands above ground today; the site is now partly beneath the 18th-century mill complex.  A stone with a carved Premonstratensian cross-head built into Mill House is thought to be a survival from the chapel.

Later history / Dissolution
• By 15th c. the residence was frequently empty; Alnwick sent a canon “only when need requires”.  
• 1539 – Alnwick Abbey surrendered to the Crown; Guyzance grange valued at just £6 13s 4d and listed among its “outlying members”.  
• 1540 – granted to Sir Ralph Sadler; the chapel quickly fell out of use and was pulled down for stone.  
• 18th–19th c. – the area developed as an industrial hamlet (Fulling-mill, iron forge, then the famous Guyzance paper-mill); any medieval fabric disappeared.

In short
Guyzance was a very small Premonstratensian out-station, never more than a two-canon grange of Alnwick Abbey.  It managed a mill, salmon fishery and fields on the River Coquet and provided occasional pastoral care for the hamlet, but it never rose to the status of an independent priory.  After Alnwick’s dissolution (1539) it passed straight into lay hands and its buildings were soon lost, leaving only the placename and a scattering of carved stones to hint at its Norbertine past.";FAUX

(SeeÂ Veiled Women, 21-22). Benedictines refounded the community after earlier Benedictine nuns left following a scandal in 1177. This scandal and reform resulted in 30 nuns being sent to other communities. The community was refounded in 1177 as a priory of the Fontevreault order at the initiative of Henry II (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 121). Amesbury was (re)colonized with nuns from Fontevrault, and the prioress came from the continentÂ Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 122). Though a re-foundation of an existing pre-Conquest community, the papal bull issued at the foundation emphasized the desire of the king to institute the order of Fontevrault, and to increase the size of the nunnery and its endowments. The pipe rolls record an expenditure of some 881 pounds (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 167). It was an alien province until 1403, then a Benedictine abbey. ; In 1400 the prioress, together with some of her sisters, was imprisoned apparently at the incitement of the prior, who had been expelled.

When Amesbury was refounded, the first prioress wasÂ Joan D'Osmont, followed byÂ Emeline,Â Felicia, andÂ Ida. In the late 13th century, Amesbury was involved in a dispute between the abbess of Fontrevraud and the prioresses of Amesbury.

Abbesses involved in this dispute includeÂ AliceÂ andÂ Margaret.

In 1186 the nuns were installed in the new buildings in the presence of the king and the abbess of Fontevrault (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 123). ; Amesbury appears to have maintained ties with Fontevrault, for in 1221 the abbess of Fontevrault corroborated with her seal a gift made by the convent (Women Religious: The Founding of English Nunneries After the Norman Conquest, 126). Amesbury in turn appears to have assumed a dominant position in relation to other English houses of the order. Prioress Joan of Amesbury witnessed a charter fromÂ NuneatonÂ and marginal notes in the cartulary ofÂ WestwoodÂ mention Amesbury agreeing to certain grants. ; The royal patronage of Amesbury was reflected in the connections of some of its inhabitants, such as the nun Alpesia, a cousin of Henry III.

There is also some evidence for pilgrimages to the statue of Mary Magdalene at Usk.";"7819 ; St. Mary's Priory ; This priory of Benedictine nuns was founded in the early twelfth century, certainly before the death of the founder, Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Lord of Usk, in 1135. (His family crest appears in some of the floor tiles recovered from the chancel). His son, Gilbert (d.1152), continued the development of the establishment, and Richard Strongbow, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (d. 1176) granted an important charter to the priory, which was confirmed in 1330 by Elizabeth de Burgh (Usk Nunnery, 44). The earliest part of the church predates the foundation and the church is mentioned in the foundation charter. The nuns thus took over an existing church and it is possible (by analogy with better-documented communities in England) that there may have been an informal community at Usk before the formal endowment of the priory. The community was founded by 5 nuns and grew to the usual 13. According to Bruce Venarde, the community was founded by Richard de Clare and his son, Gilbert, according to a document confirming the properties in 1236. Nothing is known of the first century of the nunnery's history; the first documentary mention of the community appears in 1246 when there was an inter-regnum and the community received licence to elect a new prioress. In the following year, 1247, the prioress obtained letters of protection (Usk Nunnery, 44). ; Mein suggests (St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories., 68-72) that the cult of St. Radegund of Poitiers at Usk may have been introduced by Alicia de la Marche, first wife of Gilbert de Clare (1243-95). The marriage was unhappy and ended in divorce in 1285. Gilbert did not acquire Usk until after his mother's death in 1289. Mein suggests, however, that Alicia may have received sympathy from her mother-in-law Matilda and may have stayed with her at Usk and visited the priory. Alicia's family came from Lusignan, near Poitiers, and she may have been able to acquire a relic of the saint for the nuns. Mein contends that the chapel to S. Radegund came into being at Alicia's promting and expense between 1271 and 1285. Radegund was a potentially intriguing choice for a community of enclosed nuns. After a forced (and possibly polygamous) marraige to the Frankish king Clovis, she was released by her husband to found a religious community of considerable austerity (for details see Nie inÂ Sanctity and Motherhood: Essays on Holy Mothers in the Middle Ages., 139-51; for translations of the Lives of St. Radegund seeÂ Sainted Women of the Dark Ages, 60-105). Mein suggests that Alicia may have chosen Radegund for personal devotion because of her own unhappy experience of marriage. The priory church is also the burial place of the lawyer and writer Adam of Usk (c. 1360-1440), who was related to some of the nuns, and was remembered as a protector of the convent. An anonymous early sixteenth-century poem ""Mair fadlen mawr yw dwrtais"" was written to the statue of Mary Magdalene at Usk. Cast in the form of a dialogue between the pilgim and the statue, it advises the would-be penitent to be just and charitable, and to pray regularly (Celtic Britain and the Pilgrim Movement, 318-19). Unfortunately, it offers no hint as to the appearance of the statue. ; The convent may have acquired a relic of St. Radegund of Poitiers through Alicia de la Marche, first wife of Gilbert de Clare (1243-95).

The estates at that time were tightly administered, with short-term leases and more land farmed in demesne than the men's houses in the county. Much earlier, however, Archbishop Peckham's visitation in 1284 had found the nunnery in a ""most desolate state,"" for primarily economic reasons. He recommended better accounting procedures and a senior priest to supervise financial affairs (Medieval English Nunneries, 1275-1535, 223-4; Martin 1885, 805-6). Adam of Usk's petition to the Pope on behalf of the community in 1404 (transcribed in Bradney 1921, 48-9) described the priory as devastated by the after-effects of fighting during the Glyndwr uprising, but no blame could attach to the nuns for this. According to Adam of Usk, the monastery was in such want that unless some remedy was found, the nuns would be ""forced to beg for food and clothing by wandering about the country, or to stay in the private houses of their friends; whereby scandal might arise"" (Usk Nunnery, 45). ; Benedictine ; According to Adam of Usk's petition to the pope in 1404, ""only virgins born of noble ancestry were and are wont to be received."" Adam of Usk also numbered some of the nuns among his relations. ; The community is believed to have been founded for 5 nuns, but there appear to have been more at the time of Archbishop Peckham's visitation in 1284. Knowles and Hadcock believe the community held 13 nuns. At the time of Dissolution, the Abbess Ellen Williams, resided with 5 other nuns. ; Usk in the county of Monmouthshire and the diocese of Llandaff; the community stood in close proximity to Usk Castle. ; Archbishop Peckham made a visitation to the community in 1284 and found the nunnery in a ""most desolate state,"" for primarily economic reasons. He recommended better accounting procedures and a senior priest to supervise financial affairs (Power, 223-4; Martin 1885, 805-6). One of his complaints was that the nuns of Usk were wandering outside the confines of the nunnery and staying with layfolk. He ordered that the nuns should not go out of their precinct without suitable companions, nor stay in the houses of layfolk for more than 3 or 4 days. Other criticisms dealt with economic affairs. He suggested the appointment of 2 ""provident and discreet"" nuns as treasuresses; they were to receive all monies and make all disbursements, and render account of their stewardship to the Prioress and 5 or 6 of the senior nuns at Lent, at Whitsun, and at Michaelmas. The nuns were also to have a ""senior priest, circumspect in temproal and spiritual affairs, to be master of all their goods"" (Usk Nunnery, 44). ; The oldest known part of the complex was the church, which may have predated the foundation. The Norman church was cruciform, and in the thirteenth century a broad north aisle was added for parochial use. The parish church and the nuns' choir were thus parallel and adjacent. The chancel measured 22.1 meters from east to west. The north transept of the chancel and choir of the monastic church and the priory gate-house both overlay the remains of a Roman fort and ditch, which caused considerable stress and damage to these structures. At Usk the nuns' choir and the cloister appear to have been both oriented to the south, while Roberta Gilchrist (inÂ Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women) suggests that a substantial minority of women's houses had accommodation to the north. Most of the claustral buildings lie under more recent building and the largely Victorian rebuild of ""the Priory,"" the house built after the Dissolution out of the south claustral range. However, excavation by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust and by A.G. Mein and others (Maylan 1987, Mein 1993, Mein 1994, Williams and Boucher 2000) have established the full size and layout of the priory church. The gatehouse had previously been assumed to be twelfth century, butÂ St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories.Â suggests a complete rebuild in the late fifteenth/early sixteenth century on architectural evidence. Chancel, north transept, and gatehouse (and possibly some of the claustral buildings) overlie the ditch and rampart of the Roman fort, which may explain some evidence for structural damage and the ""most desolate state"" which Peckham found there in the thirteenth century. According to Mein, another alternative might be that the ""Sisters had been 'ripped off' in truly modern fashion by a local builder whose assistance they had sought to repair the place."" Some fine datable floor tiles testify to rebuilding work in the late fourteenth and mid-fifteenth centuries. Mein believes that Adam of Usk's plea to the pope for aid, which claimed that poverty would force the sisters ""to beg for food and clothing, straying through the country or to stay in the private houses of friends,"" may have had less to do with personal poverty than with the bad state of repair of the monastic living quarters at the time he made his plea (1404) (St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories.). The church, larger in conventual days than presently, accommodated the chapel of St. Mary Magdalene and three chantries to the Holy Trinity, S. Nicholas, and ""John Edward's chantry"" (, 68-72) suggests the chapel of St. Radegund may have been the structure attached to the west wall of the north aisle shown a sketch of the church in 1799. The chapel to S. Radegund was not an original feature of the complex, but a later addition, abutting onto the north end of a range of buildings, such as the kitchens or infirmary, that would have lain along the western side of the cloister. In addition, the monastic church was surrounded by a burial ground immediately to its east; numerous burials also surround what was once the high altar of the Priory. Considerable repair work to the church was carried out in the fifteenth century by one of the Raglan Herberts. SeeÂ St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories.. ; The priory church still has its rood screen, embellished with a carving of the Virgin Mary, and there was another image of Mary in the church before which Adam of Usk wanted to be buried (Bradney 1921, 59). [The present location of the wooden screen extending right across the nave and north aisle may not be its original position.] The rood screed also bears a commemorative brass lauding Adam of Usk in Welsh (Usk Nunnery, 44). In the years immediately before the Dissolution, the then prioress, Eleanor Williams, had some remarkable panelling installed in the conventual buildings, possibly in her own apartments. The cornice is embellished with a frieze of shields decorated with the IHS monogram, the Five Wounds and the Instruments of the Passion, with royal and other armorial bearings including Catherine of Aragon's pomegranates (a brave statement of support in the 1530s). The frieze and the panelling were incorporated into the Priory House but much of the carving was removed in about 1860 to a local mansion, Cefn Tila (Rickards 1904 has drawings of the frieze). [However, recent research by John Guy of the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies at Aberystwyth suggests that the iconography of the cornice with the Instruments of the Passion and the 5 Wounds, now at Cefn Tila House but believed to come from Usk Priory, did not come from Usk at all but from the great hall at Raglan Castle and that the initials EW are those of Elizabeth Worcester,wife of the Earl of Worcester, owner of Raglan Castle, who was presumably responsible for its installation. An antiquarian's drawing depicts the cornice in situ at Raglan in the eighteenth century, shortly before the hall roof fell in. Thus the iconography of this work can not be ascribed definitely to Usk without further research.] The floor of the chancel was probably laid with stone slabs and embellished in places with decorative tiles, four of which have been recovered. The four tiles depict motifs of a fleur-de-lys, the arms of the Mortimer family (a shield within a shield), a white rosette, and the arms of the de Clare family (St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories.). Two other tiles, one depicting a curly-tailed, up-winged dragon, are believed to have come from Usk as well and probably date from 1430-1450. According to Mein, the ""subsidence effects on what was no doubt designed to be an impressive floor must have been both distressing and dangerous for the Sisters in their daily offices."" The floor, at least the part with the tiles, was relaid twice (St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories., 57). In addition, wall paintings within the claustral complex were of sufficient note to be referred to in a will. The image of St. Mary Magdalene was a prime attraction of the community. In 1514 William Bakere willed to be buried before an image of ""Blessed Mary of the Priory."" Sir Hugh David ap John gave rents to maintain the lamp burning day and night before the Blessed Sacrament, and Richard Plantagenet and Lady Elizabeth de Clare provided for the wax and oil necessary for the church's illumination. The present window east of the high altar incorporates an accurate representation of the common seal of the nunnery. The seal, an oval in red wax, depicts the Virgin Mary enthroned and holding the Infant Jesus on her left knee. The Lombardic Capital script used in the legend shows that the seal was engraved prior to the mid-14th century. The legend reads: S: SCE: MARIE: ET: CONVENTUS: DE: VSKA (The seal of Saint Mary and the Convent of Usk) SeeÂ Usk Nunnery, 45. ; Only 2 records provided much of an account of the religious life at Usk: the visitation record of Archbishop Peckham in 1284 and the petition addressed to Rome by Adam of Usk at the time of the Glyn Dwr Revolt in 1404. ; Patrons of the community were Richard de Clare and his son Gilbert (d. 1152); Richard Strongbow, 2nd Earl of Pembroke; Elizabeth de Burgh, countess of the Marches; Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March (d. 1424); and his nephew, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York (d. 1460). The latter two served as Lords of Usk. All of these patrons/benefactors were prayed for as founders and alms were given for their memory on Shrove Tuesday (Valor ecclesiasticus temp. Henr. VIII. Auctoritate regia institutus.). Richard Strongbow granted an important charter to the priory which was confirmed in 1330 by Elizabeth de Burgh. The lawyer and writer, Adam of Usk (c.1360-1440) was also remembered as a protector of the convent. A recovered floor tile with the Mortimer arms on it seems to indicate that the first dateable repair work to S. Mary's Usk was done at the expense of the Mortimer family between either 1368-1381 or 1398-1402 (St. Mary's Priory Church, Usk: some recent work and some new theories., 61). ; The present sanctuary was the medieval crossing. The present window east of the high altar incorporates an accurate representation of the common seal of the nunnery.

A new house was founded on the site in the 12th century for Augustinian canons. ; Medieval Religious Houses in England and Wales, 153, 469-470 ; Bede. 1. Foundation (685 AD):
* Historical Context: This period is deep within the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. Carlisle (Roman Luguvalium) was in the Kingdom of Northumbria, a major center of Christian learning and monasticism in England. The Synod of Whitby (664 AD) had aligned the Northumbrian church with Roman practices, including Benedictine monasticism, over Celtic traditions.
* St. Cuthbert Connection: The year 685 AD is highly significant for Carlisle. In that year, Saint Cuthbert, the famous hermit and Bishop of Lindisfarne, visited Carlisle. King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and his queen granted Cuthbert the city of Carlisle and its surrounding lands. Tradition holds that Cuthbert founded a monastery (or at least a religious community and school for priests) there, possibly based around an existing church.
* Benedictine & St. Mary: While Anglo-Saxon monasticism had its unique characteristics, it was increasingly influenced by the Benedictine Rule. A dedication to Saint Mary for a new or re-established monastic church would be entirely appropriate. The later Cathedral foundation was also dedicated to the Holy Trinity but had a strong Marian element.

2. Life in the Monastery (685 - c. 800 AD):
* Monastic Routine: The monks would have followed a life structured around the Opus Dei (the daily cycle of prayer and services), Lectio Divina (sacred reading and study), and manual labor.
* Center of Learning and Mission: Northumbrian monasteries of this era (like Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, home of Bede) were renowned centers of learning, manuscript production, and missionary activity. The Carlisle foundation, under Cuthbert's influence, would likely have aspired to this.
* Strategic Importance: Carlisle's position near the border with the British kingdoms of Strathclyde and Rheged, and its Roman heritage, made it a strategic site. The monastery would have been an important spiritual and civilizing presence.
* Resources: Endowed with lands by the king, the monastery would have drawn its sustenance from agriculture and perhaps rents.";FAUX

L'église, dont la première partie date du XIe siècle avec des ajouts successifs jusqu’au XVIIe siècle, est inscrite sur la liste des monuments historiques, tout comme la chapelle des Pénitents construite en 1844, bâtie à l’extrémité est de la place et séparée de l’église par la sacristie, le presbytère et une maison particulière[2].

Certaines parties de cette construction ont été réemployées. La façade principale présente 3 portes, celle du milieu est monumentale. Le clocher, de plan carré, a été construit en 1633. L'ensemble constitué par cette église, le presbytère et la chapelle des Pénitents, également protégée, est particulièrement homogène.

Une communauté religieuse fondée au début du XIIe siècle devient cistercienne en 1170. L'abbaye est fermée et les religieuses chassées par le pouvoir révolutionnaire à la Révolution française.

Situation
L'abbaye de La Vassin est située au sud-ouest de la commune de Saint-Donat, ce qui correspond à l'extrémité sud de l'Artense, dans la vallée de la Tarentaine, à 820 mètres d’altitude, sur une terrasse alluviale juste en aval du confluent avec le ruisseau de Neuffonds (ou « de l'Eau Verte »), et au confluent avec un ruisseau de rive droite sans nom[2],[3].

Quoique très isolé par rapport aux établissements humains (l'abbaye est située à plus de dix kilomètres de La Tour d'Auvergne, trente-six d'Ardes et trente-neuf de Mauriac[4], l'abbaye est placée stratégiquement à peu de distance de la principale route reliant au Moyen Âge Lyon à Bordeaux[5].

Historique
Fondation
L'abbaye est fondée à l'initiative de Bertrand Ier de La Tour ; suivant la tradition, il aurait fait implanter l'établissement à son retour de la deuxième croisade, soit entre 1146 (date de son départ) et 1148 (date de son retour). Une fondation à cette date s'expliquait soit par la possibilité d'y recevoir les filles de croisés, soit par la constitution d'une communauté de moniales susceptible de prier pour le succès et la sauvegarde de son fondateur, soit enfin par la création d'un lieu d'inhumation et de prière pour l'âme de Matheline, l'épouse de Bertrand décédée en 1136. Cependant, les études historiques récentes ont montré que cette dernière, appelée « fondatrice » par les documents médiévaux, a dû connaître l'abbaye de son vivant, ce qui implique une fondation avant 1136. Quoi qu'il en soit des autres motifs, la fonction de nécropole semble avoir été déterminante, ainsi que celle d'un contrôle raffermi de la région[6].

Dans les deux cas, l'abbaye est fondée loin de tout autre établissement cistercien ; en Auvergne, le plus proche durant la première moitié du XIIe siècle est Bellaigue, distante de cent vingt kilomètres. En Limousin, toutefois, les abbayes de la Valette et de Bonnaigue sont situées à une soixantaine de kilomètres, mais aucune trace d'échanges entre elles et La Vassin n'apparaît dans les archives. Il est hautement improbable qu'une fondation féminine de l'époque ait été laissée sans une certaine proximité géographique ; ainsi, les historiens du XXIe siècle supposent-ils que La Vassin, avant de basculer dans le giron cistercien, est à ses débuts soit d'obédience bénédictine, soit clunisienne ou dépendant de la Chaise-Dieu ; ce n'est alors que vers 1170, à la fondation de Féniers, que l'abbaye aurait rejoint l'ordre cistercien[6].

Du point de vue de la maison de La Tour d'Auvergne, l'abbaye est placée en un lieu stratégique, au carrefour des axes qu'elle contrôle, aux limites des zones d'influence de Rochefort, Ardes et Mauriac, sur la frontière entre Haute et Basse-Auvergne, et sur un point de franchissement des diverses rivières qui l'arrosent[6].";FAUX

It comprises the remains of the preceptory (headquarters) of the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in Scotland. The placename may be Gaelic in origin, e.g., ""Tóir Féichín"" (the boundary/sanctuary of St Féichín) or Brythonic, e.g., modern Welsh ""tref fechan"" (little town). The name ""Tóir Féichín"" with its Gaelic reference to the Boundary/Sanctuary stones set one mile around the village is most likely the true meaning of the village and Preceptory name rather than the modern Welsh which has no historical precedent that overrides the true meaning of those Neolithic sanctuary stones.

The Preceptory
The Preceptory was built in the 1140s around an existing church, possibly of early Christian origin. During the 13th Century the Preceptory was expanded, and the buildings which still stand were first erected. The complex included a cruciform church, with a nave, central tower, transepts and choir, whose tower and transepts remain, and a number of domestic buildings including a hospital. The church was extended again in the 15th Century, and a cloister completed, of which only the foundations remain. Very unusually, this was situated on the north side of the church (a feature seen elsewhere in Scotland only at Melrose Abbey).

After the Reformation, the nave of the Preceptory church was converted for use as the parish kirk, with the rest of the buildings falling into disrepair. Nevertheless, the surviving crossing of the church (below the central tower) retains some of the best-preserved late 12th-early 13th century masonry in Scotland, with refined architectural detail. In 1756 the nave and domestic buildings were demolished, and a new T-plan kirk built. The kirk is furnished with early 19th Century box pews and galleries. The remnants of the Preceptory were used as a courthouse for a number of years. The central tower was re-roofed in 1947 and is now in the care of Historic Scotland (open in summer; entrance charge).


Kite aerial photo of the Preceptory and church.
A 'sanctuary stone' in the kirkyard marks the centre of an 'area of sanctuary' that once extended one Scots mile around. The east and west 'sanctuary stones' still stand in their original positions. It has been suggested that these stones are of much earlier origin than the medieval Preceptory, possibly being related to the important Neolithic henge and burial mound at Cairnpapple Hill, to the east.

The large kirkyard has a fine collection of 17th–18th century headstones, with much intriguing 'folk art', including symbols of mortality, tools representing professions etc.

The Knights Hospitaller
The Knights Hospitaller, established during the Crusades, were invited to Scotland in 1132 by David I. After the suppression of the Knights Templar in 1312, their lands were transferred to the Knights Hospitaller. Torphichen was one of many major Hospitaller sites in Britain, second only to the Priory of Clerkenwell in London, and benefited greatly from this transfer of land.[1]

In 1298, during the Battle of Falkirk, Alexander de Welles, Master of Torphichen Preceptory, was killed. Based on the heraldic evidence there is very little doubt that Alexander de Welles was a member of the Lincolnshire Welle(s) family. Also at Falkirk were Adam de Welle(s) of Lincolnshire[2] and Philip de Welle(s).[3]


The 1764 coat of arms of the Sandilands, Lords Torphichen.
William Wallace held his last parliament here, prior to the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. The only surviving document signed by Wallace as Guardian of Scotland, Custos Regni Scotiae, was prepared here.[4] After the battle, Edward Longshanks (Edward I of England) was brought to the Preceptory for treatment of the injuries caused when his horse stood on him, whilst he was encamped at Polmont before the battle. The Hospitallers fought on the English side during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and withdrew after the Scots victory at Bannockburn, returning during the rule of Robert the Bruce.

The preceptor, Sir William Knollys, served as Lord High Treasurer of Scotland for James III and James IV, was created Lord St. John of Torphichen, and is commonly held to have died at the Battle of Flodden in 1513.

The last Preceptor, Sir James Sandilands, was the second son of James Sandilands, Baron of Calder. Sir James's father and elder brother John had both backed the Lords of the Congregation and were friends of John Knox. In February 1564 Sir James surrendered the Preceptory lands to the Crown, i.e. his relative, Mary, Queen of Scots, whereupon she gave the lands back to him for a payment of 10,000 crowns, with the secular title Lord Torphichen.[5]

The honorary post of Preceptor of Torphichen continues to be used within the modern day Order of St John of Jerusalem.";

Given its early foundation and association with a female saint, Artrea likely began as a nunnery or a double monastery (housing both monks and nuns, often under the rule of an abbess, a common feature in early Irish Christianity).

The activities at an early Irish monastic site like Artrea would have been diverse, focused on prayer, work, study, and service to the local community, all within a distinctly Irish Christian tradition.

Here's a breakdown of likely activities during its flourishing period (roughly 5th to 9th/10th centuries):

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei - ""Work of God""):

Divine Office: The core of daily life. This involved the regular recitation or chanting of the Psalms and other prayers at set times throughout the day and night (e.g., Matins, Lauds, Vespers, Compline).
Mass: Celebration of the Eucharist, likely in a small oratory (church), which would have initially been made of wood and later perhaps stone.
Private Prayer and Contemplation: Individual devotion and meditation were highly valued.
Vigils and Fasting: Austerity and penitential practices were common.
Manual Labor (Self-Sufficiency):

Agriculture: Cultivating crops (like oats, barley, vegetables) and raising livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry) on monastic lands to feed the community.
Fishing: Given its proximity to Lough Neagh and the Ballinderry River, fishing would have been an important source of food.
Crafts:
Textile Production: Spinning wool and flax, weaving cloth for habits, blankets, and other necessities. This was a common activity for nuns.
Leatherworking: Making shoes, satchels, and book bindings.
Woodworking: For building, tools, and furniture.
Basic Metalworking: For tools and simple liturgical items.
Building and Maintenance: Constructing and repairing their cells (often individual huts made of wattle-and-daub or stone), the church, and the surrounding enclosure (often a circular earthen bank or wooden palisade – a ráth or lios).
Learning, Scholarship, and Artistic Production:

Scriptural Study: The Bible was the primary text for study and meditation.
Manuscript Production (Scribal Work): Copying religious texts (Scriptures, psalters, commentaries, lives of saints) onto vellum. While not every monastery was a major scriptorium like Armagh or Clonmacnoise, even smaller ones engaged in this to some extent for their own use.
Illumination: Decorating manuscripts with intricate Celtic designs.
Stone Carving: Evidenced by the Artrea High Cross (also known as St. Trea's Cross). Though only fragments remain (dating to the 9th or 10th century), they show sophisticated carving with biblical scenes (e.g., Adam and Eve, Sacrifice of Isaac, Daniel in the Lions' Den). This indicates skilled artisans and a tradition of visual teaching. The cross would have served as a focal point for prayer, teaching, and as a boundary marker.
Annals/Record Keeping (Possibly): Some monasteries kept records of important events.
Community and Spiritual Life:

Guidance by the Abbess/Abbot: Following the spiritual direction and rule of the head of the community. Early Irish monastic rules were diverse and often based on the founder's teachings.
Teaching: Instructing novices in the monastic way of life, and possibly educating children of local patrons.
Hospitality (Féilire): Providing food and lodging for travelers, pilgrims, and those seeking refuge, which was a strong tradition in Irish monasticism.
Pastoral Care and Interaction with the Laity:

Spiritual Guidance: Offering spiritual counsel to the local population (the tuath).
Administering Sacraments: Such as baptism and confession, for the surrounding community.
Preaching: Monks might travel to preach in the local area.
The monastery often served as the social, legal (brehon law had ecclesiastical connections), and spiritual center for its territory.
Later History:
Like many early Irish monastic sites, Artrea would have faced challenges, including Viking raids (though its inland location offered some protection compared to coastal sites). Over time, with ecclesiastical reforms (e.g., the Synods of Rathbreasail and Kells in the 12th century), the structure of the Irish church changed, and many older monastic sites were either absorbed into new diocesan structures, refounded under Continental rules (like Augustinian or Benedictine), or declined.

The presence of the High Cross suggests Artrea remained an important site well into the later part of the early medieval period. Its association with St. Trea would have ensured it remained a place of local veneration.";FAUX

Killasnet in bar. Rosclogher ; in Glean Dallain (Glendallan). The exact location of Cell Osnata is sometimes debated or identified with several places, but a strong tradition links it to Skea (or Skeagh) near Ardagh in County Longford. Other places have also laid claim to the name. Regardless of the precise pinpoint location, if we consider it as a monastic foundation linked to St. Osnat, we can infer its likely characteristics and activities based on the patterns of early Irish monasticism.

Given its association with a female saint, Cell Osnata was likely founded as a nunnery or, like Artrea, a double monastery (housing both monks and nuns, often with an abbess as the head of the entire community).

Here's a breakdown of the probable activities at Cell Osnata during its early medieval flourishing (roughly 6th to 9th/10th centuries):

Prayer and Liturgy (Opus Dei - ""Work of God""):

Divine Office: The cornerstone of daily life. The community would gather for the recitation or chanting of the Psalms, hymns, and prayers at regular intervals (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline).
Mass: Celebration of the Eucharist, performed in the community's oratory or small church (initially wooden, perhaps later stone).
Private Prayer and Contemplation: Individual devotion, meditation on scripture, and ascetic practices were highly valued.
Fasting and Vigils: Austerity was a hallmark of early Irish monasticism.
Manual Labor (Labora - ""Work""):

Self-Sufficiency: The community aimed to be largely self-sufficient.
Agriculture: Cultivating crops (oats, barley, wheat, vegetables) and raising livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry) on monastic lands.
Food Processing: Milling grain, baking bread, dairy work (making butter and cheese).
Textile Production: A key activity, especially for nuns. This involved:
Shearing sheep, preparing wool.
Spinning wool and flax.
Weaving cloth for habits, blankets, and other needs.
Dyeing fabric using natural plant dyes.
Crafts:
Needlework and Embroidery: Making and mending clothing, and possibly more decorative work for liturgical use.
Herbalism: Cultivating and preparing herbs for medicinal purposes.
Other crafts necessary for daily life like basic pottery or basket weaving.
Building and Maintenance: Constructing and repairing their individual cells (often simple huts), the church, guesthouse, workshops, and the surrounding enclosure (typically an earthen bank or wooden palisade).
Learning, Scholarship, and Artistic Endeavors:

Scriptural Study: Deep engagement with the Bible was fundamental.
Learning the Psalter: Memorization of the Psalms was common.
Manuscript Work (Scribal Activity):
If the community had literate members, they might engage in copying religious texts for their own use (e.g., psalters, gospels, lives of saints).
More prominent monastic centers produced larger and more elaborate manuscripts, but even smaller ones aimed to have essential texts.
Oral Tradition: Transmitting stories of saints (like St. Osnat herself), genealogies, and local history.
Community and Spiritual Life:

Rule of Life: Following the guidance and rule set by the founder (St. Osnat) or a prevailing monastic tradition, which would have emphasized obedience, humility, and community living.
Guidance by the Abbess: The head of the community would provide spiritual direction and oversee the practical running of the monastery.
Teaching Novices: Instructing new members in the monastic way of life.
Care for the Sick and Needy: Monasteries often served as early forms of hospitals or hospices.
Interaction with the Laity (Local Community - Tuath):

Hospitality (Féilire): A key tenet of Irish monasticism. They would provide food, shelter, and care for travelers, pilgrims, and the poor.
Spiritual Guidance: Offering spiritual counsel and prayer for the local lay population.
Fostering Children (Sometimes): It was common for noble or wealthy families to send their children to be fostered and educated in monastic communities.
The monastery often served as a center of stability, learning, and spiritual life for its surrounding territory.";FAUX

""Domnach"" (from Latin dominicum) often indicates an early church, possibly founded by St. Patrick or his immediate followers. ""Cerne"" or ""Kerne"" likely refers to a local saint or chieftain.
This could be one of several ""Donaghmore"" (Great Church) sites if ""ceirne"" relates to a qualifier. For example, Donaghmore, Co. Tyrone, is traditionally associated with St. Patrick.

""Cluain"" means meadow or pasture, a common prefix for Irish monastic sites. ""Fidhi"" could relate to wood or a personal name.
This likely refers to Clonfeakle (Cluain Fiacla), Co. Tyrone, traditionally associated with Saint Lughaidh (Lugaid mac Caein), a disciple of St. Patrick, or a later St. Lugaidh.
Likely Founding Period: If associated with the earlier Lughaidh, late 5th or 6th century. If a later saint of the same name, it could be later within the Early Irish period. ""Feenish/Finish"" is harder to connect directly without more context.";FAUX

D. 1131)Â for years 787, 785). The position of bishops of Kildare seems to have been occasionally subordinate to the abbesses, and there may have been more than one bp. at certain times. In 1111, at the reforming Synod of RÃ¡th Bresail, Kildare became one of the five major Irish sees. In 1220, Henry of London, papal legate and archbishop of Dublin, supposedly ordered the perpetual fire in honor of Brigit put out (doubtful), thus asserting his control of the community. ; Current location is in the city of Kildare, co. Kildare, about 25 miles southwest of Dublin. ; Kildare is located in the valley of the River Liffey, on the fertile plains of Leinster, in the southeast of Ireland, between the Bog of Allen to the west and the Wicklow Mountains to the east, in what was then the kingdom of the UÃ­ Failge. Its position ; Cogitosus' seventh-century Life of St. Brigit contains one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of an Irish church and its surrounding settlement: ; The following list is from the 12th-centuryÂ The Book of Leinster, formerly Lebar na NÃºachongbÃ¡laÂ list of abbesses and other ecclesiastics and their communities owing allegiance to Kildare (pp. 1580-1583, cf.Â Corpus genealogiarum sanctorum Hiberniae, 112-18, 210-12). Most of the sites are near Kildare in Leinster although some were as far away as Sligo and Tyrone. ; dates and entries for annals in JVKLEINS (Kildare) ; The cathedral, begun by Ralph of Bristol around 1223, was restored in the 15th and again in the 19th century. Some medieval tombs and tiles remain. The Romanesque round tower was capped by a parapet in the 18th century. Some remains to the north of the cathedral nave were thought, in the 18th and 19th centuries, to be original to the site, including the so-called Fire House. ; Kildare was never part of a formal congregation or order, but the influence of Brigit's church in Irish politics, ecclesiastical and secular, was considerable. Kildare was the mother-church of many affiliated communities throughout Leinster and other parts of Ireland. Brigit herself was considered one of three premier saints of medieval Ireland; some references in material relating to St. Patrick and his main church at Armagh (Ard Macha, seeÂ Temple Brigid)suggest that Kildare contested Armagh's primacy in Ireland during the seventh century. Brigit's importance in Irish hagiographical material represents the powers of her abbesses and bishops during the middle ages and the rents, dues, and allegiances owed to Kildare by other, less wealthy and influential communities such asÂ ClÃºain BrÃ³naig. Churches dedicated to Brigit also existed at other, unaffiliated communities, such as Armagh. ; In pre-Norman times, control of Kildare alternated between the ruling dynasties of the province of Leinster. As in many Irish religious settlements, its major offices devolved to heirs and lesser branches of the local ruling dynasty. At its founding in the sixth century, Kildare was doubtless strongly associated with the UÃ­ Failge of the Fothairt, on whose land the monastery was situated. At this time the UÃ­ Failge were the ruling dynasty of Leinster, and Brigit was supposedly the daughter of a nobleman of this family. Bishop Conlaed was a member of the DÃ¡l Messin Corb, a dynasty that controlled northern Leinster before the UÃ­ Failge and may still have had influence, or at least prestige, at the time of the founding of the monastery at Kildare. Unlike lesser monasteries which were generally controlled by local aristocracy, famous and wealthy houses such as Kildare attracted the attention and influence of provincial overlords. From the seventh century, Kildare was usually ruled by the UÃ­ DÃºnlainge, despite the fact that it was geographically located in UÃ­ Failge land. From this point, the abbacy and bishopric of Kildare often fell to the rÃ­ogdamhna (potential heirs to the kingship) of Leinster, such as Ãed Dub (+639) and Muiredach (+965); in at least one instance, the bishop was the king of Leinster. Kings of Leinster may have resided at Kildare. The UÃ­ FÃ¡elan branch of the UÃ­ DÃºnlainge seem to have had more control over Kildare than the other two branches. After 883, the UÃ­ Cheinselaig controlled both the kingship and Kildare; seeÂ Annals of Ulster (to A. D. 1131)Â for 883, 923, 968. ; The earliest life of St. Brigit was the first extant vita composed in Ireland.(Vita sanctae Brigidae) This so-called Vita II was by Cogitosus, who was probably a monk at or near Kildare, fl. 650x675. Two other vitae of Brigit, Vita IÂ Vita Prima Sanctae BrigidaeÂ and III, are attributed to Coelan and Anmchad. A.P. Smyth suggests that MS Rawlinson B 502 was compiled at Kildare (Celtic Leinster : towards an historical geography of early Irish civilization, A.D. 500-1600, 103). Rawlinson B 502 contains, among other works, the largest collection of early Irish genealogical material.";FAUX

The community was probably of Benedictine origin. The earliest evidence of the house being Cistercian is an entry in the statutes of the order of 1491, confirming the election and installation of a prioress. The nunnery's adoption of Cistercian customs may have been relatively late in its history (Thompson, 102). ; Its most celebrated patron was Isabel de Mauduit, countess of Warwick, who was improperly styled the foundress. ; A small chancel remains of the nunnery's church, which became a private chapel of Nicholas and Catherine Fonteseue after the dissolution. The chancel measures 42 feet long, 23 feet, 6 inches wide and 17 feet high and still contains the original walls on the east and north sides. Sections of the nunnery's stone can still be seen.

It is a National Monument.[1][2]

History
The church was founded before 1215 by Geoffrey de Marisco (d. 1245) as a commandery of the Knights Hospitaller who had owned land in the area since 1200.[3] It was dissolved in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and then leased, along with its contents, to William Aspley and later to the Browne family; a new church was later built next to it.[3]

Building
The church was built for defence with high walls, prominent base batter and narrow arched windows. The tower at the west end had a barrel vault on the second floor, some of which survives. Architectural fragments and a medieval carving of the crucifixion have been set into the west wall.[3] The tops of two tombs with effigies dating to the 13th–14th century have been placed upright against the east interior wall: a tomb of a knight (possibly Geoffrey de Marisco)[4] and a badly damaged double tomb of a knight and his wife.[3][5]";

Constructed by the Knights Hospitaller, it is considered both as one of the most important Gothic monuments in Portugal and as the best Portuguese example of a fortress church.[1][2]


Interior of the church
History
In 1232 King Sancho II donated the town of Crato to the Hospitallers Order. Building of the monastery began around 1340, when the headquarters of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem were moved from Leça do Balio near Porto to Crato. A century later, the head of the order began to be known as the Prior of Crato. The monastery was made up of three different buildings, a Gothic-style fortress church, a Gothic castle-like palace, and accommodation for the monks. The entire complex has been much altered over time, particularly in the 16th, 17th and 20th centuries.[1][2]

Construction initially took advantage of the facilities of a previous monastery on the site. The church, considered the most important part of the complex, occupies the eastern half of the monument. It is arranged at right angles to the main façade and is accessed through an atrium. The church is notable for its height in relation to its narrow nave and wide transept and for the almost-total absence of interior decoration. At the entrance to the church is the tomb of the founder, D. Frei Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira. The exterior of the complex has high crenelated towers, and was clearly built as a fortress.[1][2]

The cloister was substantially rebuilt in the 16th century. At the same time, much other work was carried out on the complex, introducing Manueline, Mudéjar and Renaissance architectural styles. However, by 1615 the area was ruined and underwent further restoration. In 1897 parts of the church collapsed following a devastating storm, partly as a result of damaged previously suffered during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Full restoration was carried out between the 1940s and 1960s. The complex acquired its present form in the 1990s when parts were transformed into a hotel of the Pousadas de Portugal chain. The monastery was classified as a National Monument in 1910.";

History
See also: Portugal in the Reconquista
Belver was the first castle and most important to be constructed by the Hospitallers in Portugal during the Middle Ages.[1] It was built in order to defend the access-way along the Tagus River, and donate by Sancho I under the condition that a castle be constructed.[1] In 1194, King Sancho conceded this region of the Northern Tagus River, then known as Guidintesta, or Guidi in testa (or still of Costa), to Afonso Paes, prior of the Order of the Hospitallers.[1][2] By so doing, the King hoped to stabilize the Christian-Muslim frontier along the Tagus River, leaving the Templar to almost monopolize their power along the frontier lands.[1][3] The King began referring to the construction of the Castle and the surrounding as Belver. In his later testament, King Sancho transferred the title of the Castle to the Hospitalers.[2] By 1210, construction was far enough advanced to allow the permanent occupation and defence.[1] The testament while identifying its existence, also made it clear that the Castle was one of the six repositories of the nation's wealth, thereby providing ample proof of the Castle's defences, albeit located in a frontier outpost.[1][4] The final construction was completed in 1212.

Between 1336 and 1341, Belver fell under the most important command of the Hospitallers, while still not seat nor official House, which continued to reside in the town of Leça do Balio.[2] Even as the head of the Order transferred his rule to the parish of Flor da Rosa, in the municipality of Crato, creating the priorship of Crato, the Castle of Belver (and its community) did not progress more than a provincial stronghold.[2]


Located outside the keep walls, the small chapel of Sáo Brás
The fortress remained intact over the following centuries, preserving many of the primitive Romanesque military motifs of the period.[1] In fact, the castle was systematically adapted to military conditions of the time, while garrison accommodations were improved.[1] After becoming King, John I of Portugal renewed the Castle's important military role, and in the face of Castilian conflicts, had the Castle's defenses expanded and rehabilitated, under the direction of Nuno Alvares Pereira (in 1390).[1][2] In the 16th century, the Chapel of São Brás, was completed.[2] Similar renovations occurred in the 17th century, by Cosmander.[2]

By the 19th century, the Castle, apart from its imposing form above the parish of Belver, was completely forgotten, becoming a shelter for the settlement's cemetery in 1846.[1][2]

The 1909 earthquake caused major damage to the fortifications,[1] but only resulted in major re-construction between 1939 and 1946, when the DGEMN- Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais also continued to work on the Castle grounds annually, rehabilitate, demolish and erect major facets of the Castle.[1][2] Similarly, in 1976, the walls and roof were repaired, while the door to the chapel and altar were renovated, and in 1986, while lighting was updated on the grounds, the roof was repaired once more.[2] In 1987-1988, repairs to the donjon (plaster, masonry and pavement) were completed.[2]

On 1 June 1992, the property was transferred to the IPPAR (Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico), under decree-law 106F/92. The institute, before being absorbed into the IGESPAR, was responsible for a complete restoration and conservation of the Castle.[2]

Architecture

Located on the periphery of the village of Belver (isolated on the south-west corner), alongside the right margin of the Tagus River, at the confluence of the Ribeiro de Belver, overlooking a panorama, that includes olive orchards to the east and south-east.[2]

Its plan includes a principal rectangular keep circuited by walled parapets, that encircle the space on the hilltop, and Renaissance-era chapel. The castle gates are located on the south face, anticipated by a staircase of masonry stone, and flanked by two towers, whose design would be used by King Denis.[2][5] Beyond the entrance is a triple doorway of rounded arcs, which now provides entry onto the grounds. Central to the completed structure is the donjon or keep, whose first floor provides a grated access-way to the dungeons.[2] The keep's entrance-hall has a rectangular window and staircase that provides access to the second floor.[2] The second-floor hall, also with a rectangular window and arched doorway, leads onto the vestiges of the veranda, while another doorway leads to the superior floor access to the battlements.[1][2][6]

The walls and battlements which encircle the Castle follow a semi-circular oval around the keep, and are covered in parapets and turrets, with strategically place cubicle towers located around the entranceway and in each direction of the compass.[2] The Traitor's Gate, the secondary access to the castle, is located on the cliff side of the structure, guarded by a round tower.[1][7]


The main staircase leading to the doorway
Remains of the alcaide's residence and garrison are located in the south-east, south and south-west parts of the castle, in the space occupied by the three archways.[2] To the north is the remains of the garrison's cistern, constructed during the remodelling of the castle by Nuno Álvares Pereira.[1][6]

Near the centre of the Castle, and in the east, is the Chapel of São Brás, alongside the keep.[2] In the interior of chapel is a high-altar, with a number of busts and reliquaries from Palestine, presented by the Great Prior of Crato to Prince Luís, son of Manuel I of Portugal.[1] Italian counterparts, and decorated with the grande importance associated with the religiosity of the legendary reliquaries of the Holy Land.[1]";

History

The barbican of the Castle of Amieira do Tejo

Example of the medieval Gothic architecture, with the wall of the fortress in the distance
In 1232, owing to a regal charter issued by King Sancho II, the dominion of the Knights Hospitaler expanded their influence into the south; the religious order expanded into the villas of Amieira, Gavião and Crato.[1] In Crato, they carried out construction projects, to establish their institutional seat, just after the donation.[1][2]

The construction of the castle in Amieira only developed a century after the Hospitalers had taken possession of the territory.[1] Its construction was the responsibility of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of the Archbishop of Braga Gonçalo Pereira, prior of the Order of the Hospital and father of the future-constable of the kingdom, Nuno Álvares Pereira.[1] It was Gonçalo Pereira who had originally been responsible for transferring the Order from Leça do Bailio to Crato e Mártires (in 1356). The castle of Amieira was constructed as part of the settlement's place in the new function of the Order: to assist the travelling pilgrims.[1] Three years following this change in roles, King Peter I visited the fortress, whose construction was already quite advanced. But, by 1362, the project had not been concluded:[3] Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira had taken a lot of pacience in the construction and evolution of the castle, until his death in 1375.[1]

The fortress suffered various modifications over the centuries. During the reigns of King John II and King Manuel, there were remodelling to adapt the structure to the new military requirements.[1] Simultaneously, it served as a prison, due to its excellent construction.[1] Losing its military function, due to the change in the lines of defence over time, the castle fell in importance. In the 18th century, a great part of the historical structure was abandoned, and part of the fortress was adapted for civil residences.[1] By this time, the prison tower was partially recuperated, but its military functionally was completed abandoned.

In the 19th century, the central courtyard was converted into a local cemetery, which continued to be used in this form until the 1940s, when the DGEMN promoted the castles reconstruction. It has been listed as a National monument since 10 November 1922.[1]

Architecture

The entrance to the Gothic Chapel of São João Baptista
The castle is accessed from the Praça de Nun'Alvares, and can be reached from the EN 359 motorway, or alternately from the A6, existing from Torres Novas, IP6 until Abrantes, and the EN 118 roadway towards Nisa (exiting in Arez). The castle is found in an urban environment, isolated in a terrain with manicured gardens and space for parking. It is sited on a parcel that is relatively planar, except on the western limits where it is inclined, with houses to the north and east, while agricultural fields and orchards to the south and west.

The Castle of Amieira is the prototypical Gothic Portuguese castle.[1][4] It is located on a relatively low hilltop, in a rectangular plan consisting of a walled courtyard with four towers located at its apexes. The prison block which is located in the largest of these towers, is located above the principal entrance to the fortress. In comparison to the isolated Romanesque cell blocks, the tower also served the defence of the castle, in an area that was most vulnerable.[1][4] The central courtyard, which is an ample space, allows the space for placement of troops and easy movement. The castle also provides two levels of complementary defence, as indicated in 14th century documentation: a pit (which has not survived to today), and a barbican to the rear of the fortress, that formed a secondary landing in case of siege.[1]

Encountered by one of the towers, but outside its walls, is the Chapel of São João Baptista, which dates back to 1556 (from its doorway inscription).[1] The interior has a vaulted decorated ceiling, with an image of the patron saint (Saint John) and a retable from the late Renaissance period.[1]";
